(Christopher Columbus’ fleet in the late 1400s consisted of three ships, the biggest of which, the Santa Maria, was about 36 metres long.)</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to the Mao Kun map, also known as Zheng He’s Navigation Map and the world’s oldest nautical atlas, the circumnavigator’s fifth, sixth and seventh expeditions led the fleet through the Malacca Strait, skirting the southern tips of the Indian peninsula, and tapping the Swahili coast as far south as modern-day Mozambique.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cities such as Mombasa, the oldest port city in Kenya, were marked on the map.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Local legend has it that one of Zheng’s ships was swallowed by a storm off the coast of Pate Island and hit a rock before sinking to the bed of the Indian Ocean. This would have to have been between 1417 and 1433, the only period during which, according to most scholars, Zheng and his sailors reached the East African coast.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mama lights up when speaking of the marooned sailors washed ashore at Shanga: “That’s when our family story began.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/18/89b17a20-35be-4111-9a20-a658ec7ae73b_ff4acee5.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, she says, “we were a very closed community so maybe they were not welcomed”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But at the time, the village had a few pythons and they were giving the locals lots of trouble, so the villagers told the Chinese sailors that if they could help kill the pythons, they could stay.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“And they did manage to kill the snakes and cleared the trouble for us, so locals welcomed them and then they converted to Islam, married local women and started families.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There is no mention of how many sailors established families in Shanga, and Mama does not know how many came ashore that day, but “we have been living in this house for centuries, and this is where I grew up and where I raised my children”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This tale first reached a wider public in 1994 with the release of Louise Levathes’ book When China Ruled the Seas.

He says that even today, he is still finding treasures.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Showing his collection of broken pieces of bowls that bear resemblance to traditional Chinese porcelain design, Mansour is visibly proud.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/18/bcdd26a6-6b53-4083-8fb5-5dc42ecdf568_798e21ed.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Professor Mark Horton from the UK once came to my house when he was doing research here and helped me identify some porcelains,” he says. Mansour picks up one piece and says, “This, for example, is from Europe.” He picks up another, dusting it off, saying, “This one is from China, but I’m not sure which dynasty it was.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My neighbours keep telling me I should sell these and maybe I can make a fortune but I will never sell, because this is part of our heritage.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mansour suggests a visit to Shanga village, a 30-minute motorbike ride away, now deserted, with weeds covering barely walkable paths.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sitting under a sprawling baobab tree by the shore facing two fishing boats mooring on the sand, Mansour points to the tip of what appears to be a great rock, hundreds of metres from the shore. “That’s the rock that the Chinese ship hit,” he says, “just like the iceberg to the Titanic.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Curious tourists were not the only ones to descend on the island following the initial news reports. In December 2002, the Chinese embassy in Kenya sent two diplomats to visit the Lamu archipelago, marking their first official visit to this island, and from 2010, Chinese archaeologists also came.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/18/baeb85a6-5bf9-4604-a35d-bfbd699c0597_4d6d631f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We know about this story from our grandparents,” says Mama, recalling the thrill of telling her story to both Kenyan and Chinese archaeologists, “so it was nice to see Chinese people coming and telling us that the story is true.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In December 2005, the National Cultural Heritage Administration of China signed a memorandum with the Kenyan government to lay groundwork for a collaboration on archaeological missions in the Lamu archipelago.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Then in 2010, China sent a team of archaeologists from the National Museum, the Henan Provincial Administration of Cultural Heritage and Peking University to collaborate with Kenyan experts, including those from the National Museums of Kenya, on excavation efforts. It was the first time China had dispatched a cross-border excavation team.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From 2010 to 2013, teams conducted three archaeological missions, seeking confirmation that Zheng’s sailors had indeed been present here. Professor Herman Kiriama, former head of coastal archaeology at the National Museums of Kenya, led the Kenyan archaeologists collaborating with Chinese counterparts on a 2010 underwater mission.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We didn’t find any ship that was supposed to be of Zheng He’s fleet even after years of searching,” says Kiriama over the phone. “The currents are strong and the sea floor patterns have shifted dramatically over the years. There could be a ship, but we just can’t find it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/18/a1536693-a794-4f94-9b2b-b65968dbce01_798e21ed.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nevertheless, the expedition did yield some promising finds off the coast of Malindi, a coastal town that between the 9th and 15th centuries was the centre of the kingdom of Malindi, a Bantu civilisation that appeared on Zheng He’s Navigation Map, and a prominent location for trade with the Arabs.</p>The teams found several Chinese relics, including porcelain, that had been aboard the Portuguese frigate Santo Antonio de Tanna, also known as the Mombasa wreck, which sank in 1697 during the reign of the <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Qing dynasty’s Kangxi Emperor</span></a>, more than 200 years after Zheng’s trip.More pertinent to proving the 15th century circumnavigation, archaeologists from Peking University and the National Museums of Kenya continued land excavations at a site in Mambrui, near Malindi, where two finds stood out: a number of Yongle Tongbao, official coins cast during the reign of the Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty, and pieces of <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">blue-and-white porcelain</span></a> reserved exclusively for imperial use in the early Ming dynasty.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“[This] suggested that [the Mambrui site] is one of Zheng He’s landing spots in the early Ming dynasty,” reads a statement from the Institute of Archaeology at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, “providing materials for us to explore Zheng He’s voyage and his contact with East Africa.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But this is far from conclusive. Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama had skirted the Cape of Good Hope and reached India by way of the East African coast in 1498.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/18/d34e061e-0e16-40e2-89ed-255ea88adc3c_98165fb9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Following the establishment of that sea route, trade boomed between Asia and East Africa, and the relics that supposedly came with Zheng could also very well have reached Kenya in the Portuguese exchange of goods long after Zheng’s expedition.</p>Mwamaka Sharifu, Mama’s daughter, remembers as far back as 2002, when people from China, there on the authority of whom she does not recall, visited Mama’s house and collected her hair for <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">DNA testing</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We waited for the result, and when I asked the team what the result showed, they just told me ‘It’s OK.’ They were not really government officials, so I guess it was just for the documentary,” says Mwamaka, referring to 1405 – The Voyages of Zheng He, commissioned by CCTV and the Jiangsu provincial government in 2002.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Neither Mama nor Mwamaka saw the test results, and no public records exist of the DNA test. That the tests were performed at all was enough for some Chinese media outlets to run with it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Nanjing Morning Post quoted Mwamaka in 2005 as saying she had been informed of the results and that they were “conclusive” that “Chinese genes run in her mother’s bloodline”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/18/4d815dd9-b6a7-46ac-adde-1d9fe530c3e5_50d13e7c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Mingqing Yuan, a fellow at Bayreuth International Graduate School of African Studies, in Germany, “The DNA test seems to be a scientific proof of bloodline, but it is not really scientifically sound, or even plausible, if the heterogeneity and ambiguity of Chinese DNA is considered.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So much for science. But anecdotes abound. In the ruins of Shanga village, Mansour mentions that the name Shanga bears resemblance to Shanghai, and Siyu villagers have observed this as well.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other Siyu locals such as Walid Bihala claim tombs dotted around the island were built by the Chinese, including one ancient-looking dome between Siyu and Shanga. Here, Mansour jumps off the motor­bike and points: “There used to be porcelain in these dents, but people stole them because they were worth some money.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He shakes his head. “They were built by the Chinese.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Professor Qin Dashu, one of the archaeologists from Peking University, the dents that supposedly hosted porcelain on the dome could pass for a Chinese feature, but the inscription on the tombstones has mostly been eroded, and only three slabs of stone still preserve any text, all of which is in Arabic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/18/44c2736b-07b4-4019-9e44-9f903548737d_146f446e.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And Arab influence along the Swahili coast, from Somalia to Mozambique, is well documented. Muslim traders, mostly Arabs, settled in the region from the 8th century, followed by Persians in the 12th, and aside from Somalia being a Muslim country, most people on the Swahili coast through Kenya and Tanzania are still Sunni Muslims today (which could account for Pate island’s “lighter-skinned”, “smaller eyed”, inhabitants).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In addition to Qin’s bad news about the tombs, he says the bowl at Mama’s house has “nothing to do” with Zheng’s maritime foray. Based on the patterns and the techniques used in firing the porcelain, the bowl was made in the late Qing dynasty at the earliest, hundreds of years after Zheng.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Not that this absence of proof was going to stop a soft-power initiative. And Mwamaka would find herself at the centre of that mid-2000s Chinese media push as legends that had long been local chatter on Pate thrust her all the way to China itself, with the Chinese embassy in Nairobi directly overseeing her journey.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I have always been the talkative one in the family, so when [Chinese reporters] came to our house, I would always be friendly and chat with them,” says Mwamaka. And all those state-sponsored reports brought attention to their state sponsors, and in 2005, Mwamaka says, she “was invited to Taicang city [in Jiangsu province] to attend the 600th anniversary celebration of Zheng He’s exploration”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After the festivities in the city from which the circumnavigator had set off on his trips, she was invited for more in the Great Hall of the People, in Beijing, as an unexpected celebrity to mark the long and friendly history of China and Africa. Even if there was zero evidence of any of it.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘The Chinese are very intelligent’: When Hong Kong enchanted sailors from afar</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2017, Xi spoke of Zheng as a “friendly emissary”, who had built “a bridge for peace and East-West cooperation” – a myth that, according to Yuan at Bayreuth, was “constructed through selective remembering and forgetting based on political and economic intentions and force”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yuan says that the constant invocation of the myth of Zheng by the Chinese government is part of the “construction of itself as the legitimate inheritor of Zheng He’s historical legacy”, and the “spokesperson of Chinese ethnicity”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Wo hui jia le” (“I am home”) were the first words Mwamaka was taught to write in Chinese at the Taicang celebration, holding up the paper for the assembled cameras to capture.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are the descendants of Zheng He, and since you don’t have a family in China and you are also a descendant of Zheng He, you are part of our family,” Mwamaka recalls hearing from the family the local government had arranged for her to stay with.</p>“Do you like being called ‘China girl’ in <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Kenya</span></a>?” asked the host of Guests on CCTV in July 2005. “Yes, I do,” Mwamaka answered.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/18/6d2b6759-175c-4991-864f-6aa066898b1e_6f5ca99d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“How does it feel to be back home?” asked a reporter with Xinhua when Mwamaka was in Taicang. “It feels nice,” Mwamaka answered.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Articles about Mwamaka’s journey from Kenya to China continued to appear long after the immediate media attention had faded. In 2017, the Overseas Chinese Network website ran a story on Mwamaka’s ethnicity, and again stated that the DNA test confirmed her Chinese bloodline.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mwamaka says that during the Guests interview, she told the host she had never seen the DNA test result, but that part had been edited out of the final broadcast. In a story on 163, an online news portal, a writer adopted a first person narrative, writing that Mwamaka “always wanted to go to China because she was bullied by other people for looking different”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“That wasn’t true,” laughs Mwamaka, sitting in her flat in Nairobi, rocking her one-year-old baby boy. “No one was hostile towards me, so I think they might just want to paint this picture of me only having China to go to.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But after all this, and all the ways in which the story has been stretched to claim any link to the legend of Zheng He, there is one incontestable fact: Zheng was castrated at a young age. There will be no direct lineage to our swashbuckling adventurer for he was, in fact, a eunuch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/18/8daf2814-3bd8-4cbe-b78e-db23f3b8fcce_e018feee.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And while Zheng He is a household name in China, he rarely makes an impression in Kenya, even on Pate.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Yes, I heard that a girl went to China to study because she’s Chinese,” says Walid, “but I don’t think that happens a lot, because I don’t think anyone else went.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And as much as the matriarch likes talking up her Chinese history, Mama shrugs off any suggestion of making a pilgrimage herself.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Of course I don’t want to go to China,” she laughs. “I don’t even want to go to Nairobi.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOpaann12nsqKw0miYq6yZmLmme5JrZ2lpZmZ8qbvWZqqtp6KueqKy0aKamqajYrGmv8KepZ2dlGJ%2BdsDHZpqepqSqv7p5wqGgp52jmnqisMyiqZqkXa%2B1prrGZp%2Beq12orqq4zquqZqSZq7K0</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
