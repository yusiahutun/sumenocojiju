Each creation is limited in number, never reprinted, hand embossed, authenticated, archived, and custom-made using premium materials and advanced printing techniques.</p><p>“We’re so excited to be working with SoundWaves Creative to create some really cool Waylon posters,” shares <strong>Shooter Jennings</strong>, son of the late Waylon Jennings and an accomplished artist in his own right. “They create great art and are great folks. The Whiskey Myers guys are old friends of mine from way back and have now collaborated with SoundWaves to allow for some really cool designs for other artists as well, and I’m excited to bring Waylon into the fold!”</p><p>“Visual art has always been really important to us as a band,” reflects <strong>Whiskey Myers guitarist John Jeffers,</strong> who designed the cover art for the Whiskey Myers self-titled album as well as various tour art for the band. “Whether that’s the design on our album covers or the items at our merch booth, we see art as a way to tell even more of our music’s story. We loved what SoundWaves brought to the table for our own shows, and we’re excited to partner with them to help create art for even more artists.”</p><p>“I’m a collector of all things music, and since the inception of SoundWaves, we have implemented an archiving system highlighting supply, collaboration and year produced,” notes SoundWaves’ Fosco. “This system was designed to effectively communicate with the mind of a collector. We create media; we don’t create posters. Our media is created by a team of directors, producers, illustrators, applicators… This creative process was put in place to raise the bar on collectible music-based art.”</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4BwfJJoaW1no6TCr7DWmq2eq12Yv6at06KtnmWnnba0t8SyZKaxlafAbrzAq6unnaJiwbB5y5qsp5uYYrK5r8uuqqKulWK5qrrEZqafZZOkua2xwq2gm6SVYrq2v8icZKKmo6W2s7HDZpirrF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
