This swiftly removes the hair from the root. There are two types of waxes: soft wax, which requires cloth strips to remove and is made with rosin, oils, and other additives, and hard wax, which doesn't require strips and is typically made from rosin, beeswax, and oils.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Regardless of whether you get a professional wax or use an at-home kit, you first need to grow your hair to at least a quarter of an inch (the length of a grain of rice). This requires, time, patience, and planning – especially if you need to time your salon appointments just right.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While any part of the body can be waxed, Houston says the bikini, underarms, eyebrows, and upper are among the most common. Before waxing, the expert says it's important to exfoliate 48 hours before your appointment, drink lots of water beforehand, and take a pain reliever if needed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's also important to not use retinol or other retinoid products on the area you're waxing seven-10 days before your appointment as it will make the skin more delicate and, therefore, it may rip off with the wax, leading to wounds and scabs.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-the-side-effects-of-waxing></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What are the side effects of waxing?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During the treatment and shortly after it, you may experience discomfort in the form of redness, &nbsp;rashes, temporary bumps, ingrown hairs, and sun sensitivity. The esthetician may apply aloe vera gel after the wax to help relieve some of these side effects.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over time, Dr. DeRosa says that regular waxing can exaggerate skin aging. "Long term, the repeated pull on the skin during waxing may also result in stretching the skin and accelerating skin aging and wrinkles," the dermatologist explains.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-you-properly-shave></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How do you properly shave?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shaving is the removal of body hair using a razor that scrapes the top edge of the skin to remove hair. There are a few types of razors commonly used for hair removal: safety razors, which are typically disposable, straight edge razors, which look like an exposed blade, and electric shavers, which typically cost more but deliver a closer shave.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To prepare for shaving, simply cleanse the skin then get to work. Many opt to use a shave cream to help the razor glide smoothly across the skin. "An excellent time to shave is right after (or during) you take a shower since your skin will be warm and moist and also free of excess oil and dead skin cells," Dr. DeRosa confirms. "Use a good shaving cream or gel for the best result."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">How often you need to shave will vary based on your hair type. "For some, you may notice hair growth that warrants shaving daily while others can get away with shaving every two to three days for a clean shave," Dr. DeRosa says. "Some of this variability in frequency has to do with the hair thickness — coarser hair stubble is easier to feel than softer fine hair."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-the-side-effects-of-shaving></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What are the side effects of shaving?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Using a dull razor or applying too much pressure while running the razor over the skin can lead to razor burn, cuts, itching, blisters, ingrown hairs, contact dermatitis, and pimples (also known as folliculitis).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"One of the best ways to reduce these side effects is to be sure to change your razor (blades) frequently and to use shaving cream (not soap)," Dr. ReRosa says.&nbsp;"Shaving cream provides added hydration and lubrication to the skin during a shave.&nbsp;It also is a nice reminder of where you have already been so that you don’t go over the same place more than once." The hydration from the cream will also help keep the hairs soft, so they're easier for the razor to cut, which in turn will prevent razor burn and cuts.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-waxing-vs-shaving-which-one-is-better></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Waxing vs. shaving: which one is better?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The answer to this question comes down to which method suits your lifestyle. "Pretty much any skin type could be waxed or shaved so it’s more about what’s easier and less time consuming for you," Dr. DeRosa says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A few factors that may influence your decision are how often you need to maintain results and price.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Typically, waxing can last four to six weeks, while shaving needs to be done every few days. "Waxing results last longer than shaving. It usually takes two to three weeks after a wax for your hair to be longer than a grain of rice (the length needed in order to get a wax)," Houston says. "So your grow-out time is much&nbsp;longer. Whereas with shaving, growth can be seen within days."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for cost, a pack of razors can be purchased at the drugstore or Amazon for less than $10. With waxing, the price will vary based on the area of the body, where you live, the type of spa you visit, and the esthetician performing the treatment. Houston says that brows can be $25 and up, whereas a Brazilian can be roughly $55.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And finally, the area of the body you're working on my dictate whether you choose waxing or shaving. "Shaving is more comfortable and is easier to do on larger areas of the body," Dr. DeRosa says.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK571pqvoqaXYsO0edKhmK%2Bhnpx6s7HSrqOtq12Xsq%2BxxaKrrGWRo7Fuv8idnGadlpuypMDSZm1wbGRlfXg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
