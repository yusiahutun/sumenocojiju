As of June 2023, Forbes pegged Swift's net wealth at a staggering $740 million. That figure comes from the singer's recorded output — including the Taylor's Version re-releases of the six albums she recorded on Big Machine Records and subsequently lost ownership of the masters rights to — as well as Eras Tour tickets, which went on sale in late 2022 and immediately inspired such high demand that Ticketmaster crashed."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In 2022, she came in at No. 9 on Forbes' list of the <a href=#>10 Highest-Paid Entertainers</a>, with an income of $92 million for that year. That figure took into account her musical releases from that year, as well as the Eras Tour's impressive first two months of sales. Still, with the tour's 52 nights all taking place the following year, 2023 promises to be an even more lucrative year for Swift.</p><p>As Swift's success reaches astronomical new heights, the singer-songwriter is giving back: After the U.S. leg of the Eras Tour wrapped, Swift thanked the staff that helped her mount her tour with generous bonus checks. The production truck drivers alone <a href=#>received a bonus of $100,000 each</a>; in total, Swift spent about $5 million on bonus checks for her truck drivers.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Taylor Swift's 11 Best Country Collaborations, Ranked</h2><p>It's no surprise that Taylor Swift's voice works so well in a country setting — it is her home genre, after all!
