Throughout his marriage to the TV personality and author, Pierce has said the sweetest things about his wife of nearly 20 years.</p><p>Pierce first crossed paths with Keely in 1994. At the time, he was still grieving the death of his first wife, Cassandra Harris, whom he tied the knot with in 1980. The former pair was together for more than 10 years and welcomed their only son, Sean, in 1983, before Cassandra tragically died from ovarian cancer in 1991.</p><p>“[Cassie] made me the man I am, the actor I am, the father I am,” the <a href=#>Mrs. Doubtfire</a> star told <a href=#>People</a> in 1992. “There is an incredible cruelty in it all, losing a person you shared everything with.”</p><p>Fortunately, Pierce gave love another shot when he was introduced to Keely in 1994. It was practically love at first sight for the two as they quickly became a couple. The Die Another Day actor and his brunette beauty walked down the aisle in 2001 and expanded Pierce’s family when they welcomed son Paris later that year. The duo also became the proud parents of their youngest son, Dylan, in 1997.</p><p>“I had a great marriage which sadly had its own ending, and <a href=#>I was lucky enough to find love again</a>,” he gushed to the outlet. “We were meant to find each other. I thank God for [Keely] every day.”</p><p><strong>For more celebrity relationship news, listen to Us Weekly spill the details of Zoë Kravitz and Channing Tatum romance rumors!<strong><br></strong></strong></p><p>The feeling was completely mutual for the Poisoning Paradise actress as she once marveled over the pair’s first date. Keely recalled sitting “down under the stars” while talking the night away with her handsome beau. “[Pierce] held my hand. There were fireworks going off over our heads, and Kenny Loggins was singing,” she explained.</p><p>“We talked until three in the morning,” the mom of two sweetly continued. “He had this mischievous sparkle in his eyes. I thought, ‘Wow! Wow!’”</p><p>Even though Keely was blown away by the <a href=#>Mamma Mia!</a> alum’s dashing good looks, she insisted it was his heart of gold that truly won her over. “He’s intelligent, captivating and his real beauty emanates from the soul,” she adorably proclaimed. “And, like a fine wine, he’s aging beautifully.”</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to see Pierce’s cutest quotes about his wife, Keely!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46poJ6qk5p6o77OrKWapqNiwLixxK2crKxdpsKwwMSsZJqan6rBbsPIn5xmo5Waubp50qGYsp1dqLqqwMdo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
