They were married in February 1964. An avid music lover, Scott played guitar, mandolin, piano, violin and banjo. He enjoyed woodworking, antiques and piddling around his shop. Scott opened his own accounting firm in 1987. He was a deacon at FBC Sharon, and very active both in his community and abroad. Scott spoke fluent Spanish and went on many mission trips as a translator in Honduras and Mexico. A great husband, father and friend who will surely be missed by all.</p><p>Services will be held on Thursday, Oct. 12, at First Baptist Church Sharon. Visitation begins at 10 a.m. followed by the service at 11:30 a.m. and interment at Sharon Cemetery. Brother Matt Olson will officiate.</p><p>To sign the online guestbook, visit <a href=#><span>www.memorychapellaurel.com</span></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKeSnsG2rdGinKxnlJa7qrHLZqqcp6Speri1y6ymp2eRp8Gqr8uelmxqYJqAcoSTZm1xbGhifnKxxGaZn2tiYoOnrpZwam9qZZmAo3rHraSl</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
