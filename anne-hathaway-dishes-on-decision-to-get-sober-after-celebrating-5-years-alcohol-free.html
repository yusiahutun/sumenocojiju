We don't know if this is middle age. We don't know anything."</p><p>Hathaway, who dove more into her sobriety and aging as she promoted the film, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Entertainment Tonight</strong></a> at the film's premiere Monday, that getting sober allowed her to "take the step that I needed," something she said was "grateful" for.</p><p>As for being in her 40s, the Princess Diaries star said she feels better now than she did some two decades ago.</p><p>"I certainly am way more comfortable in my skin in my 40s than I was in my 20s.

The film, she said is a "coming of age" for her 40-year-old character, and one she was "really excited to be a part of."</p><p>While Hathaway is certainly booked and busy, both in front of and behind the camera, the now 41-year-old actress said it's her family, husband, Adam Shulman, and their two young sons, who will always come first.</p><p>"When I started out, when I first became a mom, people were like, 'Oh, how are you going to balance it?' and I'm just like, 'Balance?
