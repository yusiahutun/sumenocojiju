The 250-seat spot is being opened by the owners of Balmaghie Beverage Group and other investors. A soft opening this month will be followed in February by a planned grand opening.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Balmaghie’s chief executive officer, Chad McGehee, moved to the UAE about 14 years ago as an employee of US technology corporation IBM, and co-founded Balmaghie in 2018. He bonded with his now-business partners over their disappointment with the country’s paltry beer options.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Why, despite the zero-alcohol trend, alcoholic drinks will always be ‘in’</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We started this company so that we can drink better here,” says McGehee, a native of the US state of Louisiana. “Regardless of the size of the market, we legitimately made this beer for us to drink, and then it just kept growing.”</p>The company opened beer-making facilities, as well as gin and whisky distilleries, in the US state of Pennsylvania, and worked on flavours they thought <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">would appeal to expatriates</span></a> in the Gulf: pale ales, Czech and German-style Pilsners, stouts and lagers.The company began selling beer in the UAE in 2019, and spirits more recently. Side Hustle also makes <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">hard seltzers</span></a>, which McGehee says are popular in the UAE even as the hard seltzer buzz fades in the United States.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/12/12/dbbc68c5-2622-4d71-ba39-6589db3d3a79_cd69dc05.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The brand’s identity is explicitly linked with the UAE, McGehee says: Side Hustle’s camel mascot appears on its cans and bottles, which are also sold in the US and other countries. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the company held a craft beer festival in Abu Dhabi called Hustle Fest, featuring dozens of beers from US brewers.</p>In the UAE, most laws governing alcohol are set by each emirate, not at the federal level. Within recent memory, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">in the relatively liberal emirate of Dubai</span></a>, alcohol could be served legally only at a few bars and restaurants, usually as part of a hotel; it was banned in daytime hours during the holy month of Ramadan.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now, however, retail stores selling beer, wine and hard liquor are commonplace, and free-standing restaurants and pubs with alcohol licences exist throughout Dubai.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/12/12/e80d8038-b39d-43e6-af5b-cbf68112daf3_286615fc.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Still, the production of alcohol is a big step for the Gulf, a region where several countries still ban the sale, consumption and possession of alcoholic drinks. As the countries’ economies and tourism sectors grow, so does the demand for a lifestyle that expats are used to in their home countries – or in places such as Singapore or Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although Dubai is the glitzier destination and attracts more tourists, other UAE emirates have taken the lead on loosening other Islamic laws: Ras el Khaimah, to Dubai’s north, for example, looks poised to be the first emirate to allow gambling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/12/12/3b333b77-7b37-4532-9945-d8324d7136e1_aabc33fe.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Craft breweries have opened in places in the Middle East such as Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt, and craft beer is imported into the UAE. But locally brewed beers are still a very small part of the market.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Craft microbrewery will be on Abu Dhabi’s Al Maryah Island, one of the many natural islands that make up the heart of the emirate. It is part of a luxury retail, dining and entertainment complex called The Galleria.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Craft’s neighbours will include international high-end chain restaurants Zuma, Em Sherif Cafe and Coya, and Michelin-star 99 Sushi Bar. Five-star hotels Four Seasons and Rosewood are also on the island.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/12/12/60c0d8c0-5ed0-4a0a-b205-1b5342826785_b04a0af1.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The brewpub is opening in an expansive location that has several dining areas. One space has a direct view of the beer brewing equipment, such as a mash tun and tubs. Menus above the bars show what brews are available that day.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Craft will also serve cocktails, some made from Side Hustle spirits.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The brewery has the capacity to make about 25,000 pints of beer a month. The brewing time for most beers will be about three weeks. Hops and other ingredients will be imported, for now.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The goal is to make 75 different kinds of beer over the next year, though only five or 10 might be available at any given time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZMGzrdWeo2aklZ7Atr7EaJirrJmYuaZ7kmtrbW9mbXyntdGsq2atkZp6o77EsJyrsV2irqyxjJqlnWWjmrmtecGenKtlkZfCbrDHmpmiZZKetG6vx5qloJ1drLWmuoylppyZnKHGbrzRqJuum5WZeqK4wqifqKRdrK60ecilo56fkaE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
