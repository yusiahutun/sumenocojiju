The Beat Bobby Flay star is also the wonderful father of his only daughter, <a href=#><strong>Sophie Flay</strong></a>.</p><p>Bobby welcomed his beloved little girl in 1996 alongside his second wife, <strong>Kate Connelly</strong>. The pair tied the knot in 1995, but called it quits after three years of marriage in 1998. Fortunately, their split has not gotten in the way of Bobby’s relationship with Sophie as they always find plenty of time to hang out.</p><p>“We have a lot of similar interests. We like a lot of the same TV shows. We actually like a lot of the same podcasts,” Sophie shared with <a href=#>Parade</a> in August 2019. “We also love horse racing, and being able to share that bond has been great because he got his love for horse racing from his grandfather and it has now passed down to me.”</p><p>Aside from attending events like the Preakness Stakes and hanging out at home, Bobby and his brunette beauty also love working together. The famous father-daughter duo have even starred in their own <a href=#>Food Network</a> show The Flay List, which ran for one season throughout 2019.</p><p>“I have a very close relationship with Sophie,” the cookbook author told the outlet. “We share a very fruitful life together and it has always revolved around food because of what I do for a living, and her exposure to it, as well as her growing love of food in general.”</p><p>Considering Sophie grew up around a culinary genius, it’s no surprise she’s following in her dad’s famous footsteps. In Bobby’s opinion, the stunning TV personality was always a natural.</p><p>“Being able to go and eat in restaurants in New York with her and shooting the show was not a difficult thing at all,” he gushed. “We had fun shooting it and there were some surprises on my end for sure. It was really nice being able to see her have her point of view when it came to food.”</p><p>Whether or not Bobby and Sophie continue to work together in the future, the doting dad said he’ll always share a close relationship with his only child. “I think that Sophie is going to eclipse me in every part of her life,” he sweetly said. “She has a special way about her. She’s well-liked, and she’s very inclusive to everyone around her.”</p><p><strong>Keep scrolling to learn more about Bobby’s daughter, Sophie!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46bppuaqWKzra3YZqKinKNiuqax02aroZ1dmLWmstJmpqekqWKxosHGoaueql2ovLG0yJ5kn6SRrnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
