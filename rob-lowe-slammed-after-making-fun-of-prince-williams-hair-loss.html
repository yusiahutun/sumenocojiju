Rob Lowe has come under fire after he poked fun at Prince William‘s hair — or lack thereof — in a new interview with U.K. newspaper The Telegraph. Royal fans slammed the handsome Parks and Recreation actor’s response after he was asked if he considers himself “more or less vain than British men.”
“That’s a low bar! Can we talk about William?” Rob, 55, said in reply to the awkward question. “I mean, the future king of your country let himself lose his own hair, so when I say British men set a very low bar…” he continued."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Can we talk about William?” Rob, 55, said in reply to the awkward question. “I mean, the future king of your country let himself lose his own hair, so when I say British men set a very low bar…” he continued. Rob then made a shocking admission. “Honestly, one of the great traumatic experiences of my life was watching Prince William lose his hair. He’s going to be the f–king king of England!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/rob-lowe-firefighters-dinner.jpg><p>The West Wing star then offered some advice for the 36-year-old royal. “There’s a pill [to combat hair loss],” he explained to the outlet. “The first glimmer that a single hair of mine was going to fall out, I was having stuff mainlined into my f–king veins. And that’s what I did for the next 30 years.”</p><p>Shortly after the interview was published on Tuesday, May 28, backlash came rolling in regarding Rob’s comments about the Duke of Cambridge. “Rob Lowe should keep his opinions about British men to himself. Both he and his wife and full of Botox and fillers. Nothing wrong with a natural man,” <a href=#>one Twitter user wrote</a> on the social media site.</p><p>“Hey Robbie, some men who would be king are secure enough with their masculinity that they don’t care to take pills for 30 years to save their hair. You’re obviously not one of them. I think William is hotter without hair then you are with,” <a href=#>fired back another</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/william-speech.jpg><p>One royals fan even <a href=#>pointed out</a> the fact that William is a huge advocate for bullying. “@RobLowe did you even stop to think how it would make William feel for you to draw attention to this? Are you NOT listening to William’s mental health statements?”</p><p>Many fans did come to William’s defense, but luckily the royal knows <a href=#>how to poke fun at his own cost</a>. When he and <a href=#><strong>Kate Middleton</strong></a> introduced their first royal child, son <a href=#><strong>Prince George</strong></a>, to the world following his birth in 2013, William joked that the seemingly bald infant has “got way more hair than me, thank God!”</p><p>We hope William laughs Rob’s joke off!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46rpptlnKTEpnnSpZimpZWZeqKy056pZqWRoLavs4yfrKdln5t6sb7Ip5qeZaeeua21wKaqZqCRnr9uuM6sqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
