Swift offers very little insight about 'Ours' in an official statement she's made about the song (quote courtesy of her label, Big Machine): &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The lyrics give us that much.</p><p>"'Cause I love the gap between your teeth / And I love the riddles that you speak / And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored / 'Cause my heart is yours," she sings in the lyrics of the song's most leading verse. So, we're looking for a guy with tattoos and a gap between his teeth.</p><p>Rumored ex-boyfriend Jake Gyllenhaal was pictured with a <a href=#>Pittsburgh Steelers tattoo</a> that might offend Swift's father -- a <a href=#>Philadelphia Eagles fan</a> -- but that turned out to be a fake. Plus, he has near perfect teeth, and even if he began dating Swift before the record was released (media reports show them together as early as Nov. 2010), it wasn't early enough to allow her time to write and record a song for inclusion. Albums are typically finished weeks, if not months, prior to release.</p><p>Swift's 'Mine' video (filmed in the summer of 2010) co-star Toby Hemingway may fit the timeline, but <a href=#>his tattoos</a> are hardly offensive. In fact, unless the actor was strutting around without a shirt on in front of Swift's dad, he probably wouldn't have even seen them. Hemingway does have a sizable gap between his teeth, though.</p><p>But nobody criticized him as much as Swift's relationship with <a href=#>John Mayer</a>, which is already the subject of at least one song on 'Speak Now.' His arm is covered in tattoos, and his reputation as a ladies man would make him every father's nightmare. Photos of the singer are almost exclusively tight-lipped, but some say he has a gap in his bottom teeth. There's speculation that more that one song on 'Speak Now' is about Mayer; some suggest as many as six, although that seems unlikely.</p><p>The problem is it's difficult to imagine someone who's been hurt so deeply singing the lyrics of a song like 'Ours' in public: "So don't you worry your pretty little mind / People throw rocks at things that shine / And life makes love look hard / The stakes are high, the water's rough / But this love is ours."</p><p>Fans may be forever left guessing the identity of the muse that inspired her 'Ours' lyrics, as neither she nor he seem willing to let the secret slip between their gapped (or gapless) teeth.</p><p><strong>Watch Taylor Swift Sing 'Ours' at the 2011 CMA Awards</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmrZmpobyzedKwoJ%2BsXaTCs7%2BMpbCroZOofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
