He was gone 22 seconds later, soon ruled out with left hamstring soreness.</p><p>Coach Jason Kidd said he wasn’t sure if Doncic would make the trip to Oklahoma City, where the Mavs finish a back-to-back on Thursday night.</p><p>“We’ll have a better answer (Thursday),” Kidd said. “This is a fluid thing. This thing is being talked about now.”</p><p>The Warriors were without Stephen Curry for a third consecutive game, and it showed with sub-40% shooting almost the entire game in a fifth loss in six games this season without their star guard.</p><p>Golden State is 1-2 since Curry has been sidelined by a sprained right ankle. Steve Kerr said before the game Curry should join the team in Los Angeles, and the coach is hopeful Curry will play Saturday against the Lakers.</p><p>The Warriors also were without Draymond Green, who was scratched before the game with back soreness. Jonathan Kuminga led Golden State with 27 points.</p><p>“What Draymond does, he puts his impact on the game one way or the other,” Kerr said. “Doesn’t matter. People get hurt, and you’ve got to respond.”</p><p>All of Gafford’s buckets came on dunks, and he is two short of Chamberlain’s NBA record, set in 1967. The 6-foot-10 center acquired before the trade deadline had a season-high seven blocks.</p><p>“I try to tell myself not to worry about it,” Gafford said. “If I do it, that’s good. I’m going to celebrate it, of course. I just want to come out and win games. I’ll worry about the record after for sure.”</p><p>Doncic had nine assists and three rebounds. His triple-double run included NBA records of five consecutive with at least 35 points and six in a row with at least 30 points.</p><p>While the Warriors didn’t shoot well from anywhere, the Mavericks withstood one of their worst nights of the season from 3-point range, starting 1 of 17 before finishing 6 of 27 (22%).</p><p>Doncic threw his arms in the air after his only connection from deep in the third quarter. He was 1 of 6 from beyond the arc, while Kyrie Irving was 1 of 5 while finishing with 23 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds.</p><p>The Mavericks took control with an 11-0 run for an 87-72 lead while Doncic was sitting early in the fourth quarter. His return didn’t last long, but the Mavericks continued to pull away without the five-time All-Star.</p><p>Andrew Wiggins scored 17 points for Golden State, which lost for just the second time in 11 road games in a matchup of teams that started the night in position for the play-in tournament.</p><p>“I like the team a lot better now than I did a couple of months ago where we were really sorting through things,” Kerr said. “We have an identity. I think we’ll bounce back here, and I’m excited about the last part of the season.”</p><p>UP NEXT</p><p>Warriors: At the Lakers on Saturday.</p><p>Mavericks: At Oklahoma City on Thursday.</p><p>___</p><p>AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfqL2wvtOsZpqoXaHCrK2Mnaanm5mYerSvzqucrGViZnq1vsipo55llKTCo7jEZqqtqpWWuG6xzZ2qZpmkYoRurdJmpJquo2LArbvGZqeaq6RixKK%2B0aKmq6tdZn16eZhyZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
