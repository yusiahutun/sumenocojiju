Tisci says he got to know Kim, and between his efforts and Kanye’s, the pair were able to smarten-up Kim’s reality TV star wardrobe—extreme makeover style."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But I didn’t care. That is a friend, you see.”</p><p>He may have copped some slack in the beginning, but the&nbsp;friendship has&nbsp;paid off for the Givenchy boss, who was asked to&nbsp;<a title="The First Full-Length Photos Of Kim Kardashian’s Wedding Gown Have Arrived" href=#>design Kardashian’s wedding dress</a>. Thanks to a complete style 180, Kim’s officially secured her status as a bona fide fashion girl, and is now the&nbsp;celebrity&nbsp;who designers most want to dress–and she even has the <a href=#>Vogue cover</a> to prove it.</p><p>Tisci agrees&nbsp;that his loyalty to the couple has paid off: “And this is why, when they got married, they asked me to dress them. They say, “You’ve always been with us. You’ve been a real friend.” If I like somebody, I like somebody. If I don’t like somebody, I don’t like somebody.”</p><p>Tisci’s interview has been released only a couple of days after Kanye <a href=# rel=nofollow>admitted to Style.com</a>&nbsp;that he lost fashion friends because of Kim: “And all the relationships, the somewhat friends that I had somewhat built up, completely turned their backs on her and me. They already had their back to her, and now they turned it to me,” Kanye said.</p><p>Well, you showed ’em <a href=# id=auto-tag_kimye data-tag=kimye>Kimye</a>.</p><p>Head over to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Details</a>&nbsp;to read the full interview with Riccardo Tisci.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ynrdKhoKimXaOyuL%2BObGttaGNpfK%2B7waibsmWRmLCmvNOem2ajmaJ6rK3RnZisoJmWu261zWaroZ1dm660tMiopWabn6K6trrIrbBmq5GuwG6zyK%2Bcp5uYrsCztcKcmKucn2LBqr%2FComY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
