But one thing is clear - he is an inspiration to everyone who wants to make it to the top of any field, be it sports or anything else.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Dive into this Swiss basketball player’s background - his family, his childhood, and his relationships - in the article below.</p><h2 dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Clint’s Family And Background</h2><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Clint Capela is not one of those people who are born ‘with a silver spoon in their mouths.’ He was born to African immigrant parents - a Congolese mother and an Angolan father, who left his mother to deal with her problems shortly after Clint’s birth. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>After his father’s departure, Clint’s poor mother, who used to work from dusk to dawn to meet needs, put Clint and his elder brother Landry&nbsp;Capela in a school and group home. They only went home to meet their mother and their older sibling, Fabrice Capela, on weekends.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><strong>Read More:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# title="Nicolas Batum Wife, Dating, Parents, College" rel=follow>Nicolas Batum Wife, Dating, Parents, College</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Clint grew up moving from group home to group home and playing football and basketball on the streets.&nbsp;Despite the hardship, the athlete never gave up and always put his truth in his mother above anything else. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Finally, the athlete made his NBA debut in 2014, after being drafted by the Houston Rockets. So, after his draft in the NBA, the player paid his mom’s debt of over 20 years. It took almost all of his rookie salary to do that. He said,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>It just made me so proud to tell my mom that she didn’t need to work anymore. Now she can be happy and do what she wants. Now she gets to go back to Congo to visit her parents and her sisters, then comes back and spends time with me here in Houston.
