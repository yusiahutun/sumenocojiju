It was her first year as a Girl Scout and her first year to sell the familiar boxes of treats. She says that she and her mom went door to door every Friday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., and set up at grocery stores on Saturdays and Sundays, always with a smile and a box of cookies in her hand.</p><p>“I feel that being a Girl Scout is good because you get more education and get to play with other girls,” Shelby said. “I learn a lot.”</p><p>Shelby was a little surprised to be the highest seller.
