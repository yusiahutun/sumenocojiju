The star went on to feature in Scarecrow and Serpico, and already had two <a href=#>Oscar</a> nominations under his belt.</p><p>Two years later, he was preparing to reprise his role alongside <a href=#>Robert De Niro</a> in the sequel.</p><p>However, while filming, Al was hit with a serious illness and taken to hospital while the crew were filming in the Dominican Republic.</p><p>The Godfather co-star Lee Strasberg worried about Al Pacino’s <a href=#>health</a> and rang his doctor when his condition worsened in hospital.</p><p>His physician stepped in and flew the <a href=#>celebrity</a> back to the US for treatment, and when he recovered, told him it could have been fatal if he didn’t fly back that day.</p><p>Al <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> Entertainment Weekly: “The doctor told me I would have died if I’d been in there one more day.</p><p>Despite suffering at the time, he recovered and he went on to receive another Academy Award nomination.</p><p>The star has been nominated nine times but only walked away with the golden statue once – for his role in Scent of a Woman which he also snatched up a <a href=#>Golden Globe</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-scene-that-saved-him-and-the-director>The scene that saved him and the director</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Many movie fans will hail The Godfather films as one of the greatest trilogies from the industry, and it’s odd to think Al Pacino may not have been a part of it.</p><p>The studio wanted a bigger name for the bill when casting, but Coppola was adamant on hiring Al.</p><p>The actor himself didn’t think he’d get the part, thinking he would be given another character.</p><p>He said: ”I didn’t understand why Francis wanted me to play that part.”</p><p>”I was shocked, like everybody else. I always thought he wanted me for Sonny, but Michael was the only character he saw me as”.</p><p>But the director had butted heads with the studio more than once while filming too, over creative differences for the tragedy.</p><p>Paramount grew concerned about his vision for the film, but one vital scene with Al Pacino in The Godfather helped them change their minds.</p><p>The scene in question is when Michael shoots a corrupt police officer and a drug dealer in cold-blood in a small Italian restaurant. It’s seen as the ‘awakening’ of Michael as the heir to the Corleone family, following in the Don’s footsteps (Marlon Brando).</p><p>After Michael steps out of the bathroom, he walks up to the two men eating dinner and shoots them – but there is no score, just silence afterwards.</p><p>Once the studio saw Pacino at work, they backed down, and let Coppola finish with his vision.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2eBcK3LZqeam5mjvG6ty6amrKxdmbamsIywn6KklWKzqrjMoqWgZaSdsm6zzp2dmqyYmr9uv8SqrJ6kXaq7tbXLZpqoZaOprrO%2FjKqsopubYsGptc2koKefXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
