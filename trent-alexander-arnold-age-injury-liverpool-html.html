After his debut, he signed his first professional contract with Liverpool&nbsp;in October 2015.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Since his contract signing, he has risen consistently in stature and importance for the Liverpool team, and also for the England National Team.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Parents And Family</h2><p style=text-align:justify>A Liverpool native, Trent took birth in a family that had a lot of respect for the community. His mother, Dianne Alexander, taught him at an early age that community was everything. That teaching still affects Trent, who visits the St. Andrews Community food bank frequently and helps with the food supplies. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>As for his dad Michael Arnold, he is a businessman. Both Michael and Dianne&nbsp;raised Trent, along with his brothers, in a down-to-earth manner. At a period when many of the young players move out of their parents’ homes immediately after starting to earn a bit of money, Trent stayed with his parents until very recently.</p><p style=text-align:justify>It was only in May 2019 that he finally made a move towards independence, purchasing a five-bedroom house in Hale, Chesire, for $3.48 million. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Trent has two brothers - who are also his best friends. One of his siblings,&nbsp;Tyler,&nbsp;acts as Trent's&nbsp;agent, while the other is named&nbsp;Marcel. His brothers have been very selfless in helping Trent achieve his dreams of playing football professionally.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Trent Alexander-Arnold poses with his PFA Team of the Year award alongside his family</strong> (Photo: Alamy) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>They sacrificed their own playing time during&nbsp;childhood so that Trent could be on time for training. To signify his brothers' importance,&nbsp;Trent says that everything that he has achieved is an achievement of all three of them.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Salary And Contract</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Along with the increase in Trent’s stature in the football&nbsp;world, his worth has also increased. The athlete's team&nbsp;Liverpool FC is aware of his talent and importance, and pay him his worth. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Another England Player:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Jadon Sancho Contract, Salary, Transfer, FIFA 19 Stats" rel=follow>Jadon Sancho Contract, Salary, Transfer, FIFA 19 Stats</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Trent signed a new contract with Liverpool on 19th January 2019.

His mother, Dianne, jokes that it would be hard for him to have a girlfriend as his potential partners would have to get her approval and permission first, before actually dating him. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>However, it isn’t the case that Trent has never been involved with a woman. But, the&nbsp;solitary story of Trent’s involvement with a person of the opposite gender could be considered a naive mistake on Trent’s part.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Another Football Player:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Detail On Dele Alli's Dating Status, Girlfriend, Family, Religion" rel=follow>Detail On Dele Alli's Dating Status, Girlfriend, Family, Religion</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>The Liverpool star was supposedly flirting with a pregnant woman named Nicole Heaton during the FIFA World Cup 2018 in Russia. The woman also claimed that he sent her some 18+ messages. However, nothing has been conclusively proven yet, and Trent, too, is yet to address the allegations.
