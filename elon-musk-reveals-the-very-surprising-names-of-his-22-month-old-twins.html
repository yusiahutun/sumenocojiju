(The tweets were later deleted.) &nbsp;"Long-distance relationships when both partners have intense work obligations are always difficult, but who knows what the future holds."</p><p id=eR7TPk5A7C data-wc=39>"I just broke up with my girlfriend. I was really in love, and it hurt bad. Well, she broke up with me more than I broke up with her, I think," Elon later told Rolling Stone of their romance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKSorJiav26tzZ1km5mSrnx2fJFpbnJnlaG8r3nMrqqkZaKaw6aty6xkraCVYsOmvthmqq6qoKe2tLXNoGSnmZ2awG67xWafoqtdZ39uuc6nq6Fln6GxbsDWoqWsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
