While Gen Z’s love for vintage pieces has given many of these Y2K trends new life, those who grew up in the era will remember all the brands that originated these styles.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Many fashion labels that reached their peak in the early aughts were instantly recognizable thanks to an emphasis on logo apparel. You could spot a Juicy Couture velour tracksuit from a mile away with its blinged-out designs, and Von Dutch trucker hats were sat on the head of nearly every A-lister. Style icons of the time, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Britney Spears</a> and Paris Hilton were often snapped repping these brands, which had consumers scrambling to recreate their looks. (Yes, even the bedazzled low-rise jeans.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While you can still shop some of the original apparel on resale sites, most Y2K brands <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>have new collections</a> that take inspiration from their heyday. If you’re nostalgic for the era of flip phones and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>shopping malls</a>, here’s a refresher on the popular fashion brands from the 2000s and why they're making a comeback.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-juicy-couture></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Juicy Couture</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Theo Wargo/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Velour tracksuits were everywhere in the early aughts, with celebs like Paris Hilton and Jennifer Lopez popularizing the athleisure look. Juicy Couture’s take on the two-piece ensemble came in nearly every color and typically had the word “Juicy” printed across the fabric in diamanté. In 2020, the brand relaunched its website with a new collection of tracksuits inspired by iconic styles of the 2000s.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-baby-phat></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Baby Phat</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bill Davila/FilmMagic</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Model Kimora Lee Simmons launched Baby Phat in 1999 and was the creative director of the brand until 2010. The brand redefined streetwear in the early aughts with its bedazzled baby tees, zip-up sweaters, and low-rise jeans—all emblazoned with the iconic cat logo. Simmons officially relaunched her brand in 2019 with a Forever 21 collaboration and a new collection of velour tracksuits and bedazzled tank tops.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ed-hardy></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ed Hardy&nbsp;</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>JIL Studio/FilmMagic</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">No graphic T-shirt was quite as popular as an Ed Hardy tee in the 2000s. Britney Spears, Madonna, and Kim Kardashian are just a few of the celebs who were frequently spotted in their Ed Hardy gear. The brand was known for its tattoo-style designs that were on everything from baby tees and hoodies to trucker hats. Addison Rae and Bella Hadid helped revive the brand in 2021 when they were seen wearing Ed Hardy apparel. The brand now has a collection dedicated to Y2K fashion.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-von-dutch></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Von Dutch</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Kevin Winter/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A Von Dutch trucker hat was the accessory of the early 2000s. Gwen Stefani and Nicole Richie often wore the label, founded in 1999, which also carried logo tees that were another favorite amongst celebrities. In 2020, Von Dutch relaunched as a luxury brand with a limited-edition denim collection.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-true-religion></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>True Religion</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Steve Granitz/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">True Religion jeans were so popular in the 2000s that Fergie gave the brand a shout-out in the Black Eyed Peas song “My Humps.” The brand’s denim was defined by its horseshoe pocket and thick stitching—seen here on Jessica Alba in 2005—which transformed any outfit into a statement look. After filing for bankruptcy in 2017 and 2020, True Religion re-emerged with a Supreme collaboration and nostalgic collections that feature more than just jeans.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-diesel></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Diesel</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>J. Vespa/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Diesel has been around since 1978, but the brand really took off in the ‘90s and 2000s with grungy offerings like tight, low-rise jeans and bodycon dresses in bold prints. Thanks to A-listers Gigi Hadid and Dua Lipa, who sported several Diesel designs in 2022, the clothing label is in high demand once again.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-abercrombie--fitch></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Abercrombie & Fitch</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Denise Truscello/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Walking into an Abercrombie & Fitch store in the 2000s was a very distinct experience, with its dimly lit spaces and a strong scent of perfume in the air. The iconic mall brand was known for its polos, graphic tees, and ripped jeans, but was later criticized for its limited sizing and lack of diversity. In 2017, the new CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch, Fran Horowitz, ushered in a rebrand by hiring more diverse models and offering more inclusive sizes.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aropostale></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aéropostale</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Barry King/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another mall mainstay of the early aughts was Aéropostale. This brand was just as popular as Abercrombie & Fitch but offered more affordable apparel. Its classic logo tees were spotted everywhere, including on the red carpet as Mischa Barton wore one to the 2004 Teen Choice Awards. In 2016, Aéropostale filed for bankruptcy, but it's gotten some traction on TikTok in recent years for its crop tops and denim.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-blumarine></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Blumarine</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Steve Granitz/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Blumarine was established in 1977 but reached a peak in the early 2000s. The label became a go-to for party dresses, with stars like Lindsay Lohan and Brittany Murphy stepping out in the romantic yet sexy designs. In 2021, Blumarine had a resurgence with its Y2K-inspired collection of butterfly motifs, micro mini skirts, and sheer floral dresses.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-skechers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Skechers</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>J. Vespa/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chunky sneakers have made their way back into “cool-girl” fashion, but Skechers first had its moment way back in the 2000s. Pop "It girls" Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera were featured in Skechers campaigns, so the lace-up tennis shoes quickly became synonymous with Y2K fashion. The iconic brand has picked up momentum recently with its various collaborations with Diane von Furstenberg, Martha Stewart, and Snoop Dogg.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tommy-hilfiger></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Tommy Hilfiger</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Theo Wargo/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Tommy Hilfiger was all about statement pieces in the late ‘90s and early 2000s. The flag-logo apparel and baggy denim were a hit with musicians like Aaliyah and Gwen Stefani. "Tommy Girl" tanks (seen here on Paris Hilton in 2002) were also popular at the time, though they can only be found on resale sites now. However, Tommy Hilfiger is still thriving after releasing a successful <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>collaboration with Zendaya</a> in 2019 and launching the Classics Reborn collection in 2023, which reinvents some of the brand’s preppy styles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-miss-me></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Miss Me</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>J. Quinton/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Miss Me launched its first collection in 2001 and quickly became a denim staple. Beyoncé was known to venture out in these jeans, which were recognizable by the small red tab that was stitched into the front pocket and often featured intricate embroidery. Vintage Miss Me denim from the early aughts can still be found on Depop, but the brand is also turning out new designs that take inspiration from the 2000s styles.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-lacoste></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Lacoste</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Peter Kramer/Getty Images For IMG</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Preppy fashion</a> is back, and in the early 2000s, Lacoste was the go-to label for knit sweaters and polos featuring that signature alligator logo. The brand was known for its clean and minimalist designs, which made them perfect for layering. Lacoste has leaned into being a luxury brand in recent years by collaborating with stars like Bruno Mars and creating more elaborate retail experiences for their customers.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-le-tigre></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Le Tigre</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Theo Wargo/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rivaling Lacoste was Le Tigre, another preppy brand known for its simple polo shirts. Established in 1977, it became popular in the ‘80s before having a major revival in the early aughts. In 2023, Le Tigre launched its first footwear collection to expand upon its apparel line, which features its iconic tiger logo.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-adidas></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Adidas</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Steve Granitz/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Adidas apparel has always been in demand, but in the early aughts, the brand’s zip-up track jackets (as seen here on Queen Latifah in 2002) and Samba sneakers were all the rage. These athleisure staples are still just as popular today, as Sambas have become the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>unofficial shoe of supermodels</a>, with Emily Ratajkowski and Kendall Jenner often sporting them.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ugg></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ugg</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>James Devaney/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ugg boots were a controversial shoe choice in the 2000s, but they were spotted on every A-lister from Sarah Jessica Parker to Heidi Klum. This comfort shoe was often styled with distressed denim, mini skirts, or velour track pants for a very early-aughts look. Today, Ugg is as popular as ever, with stars favoring the brand’s platform slippers and mini boots.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-claires></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_77-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Claire’s</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jean Baptiste Lacroix/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_79-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the 2000s, Claire’s was the one-stop shop for ear piercings and accessories like butterfly clips and hoop earrings. As of 2022, the iconic mall brand is making a strong comeback. Olivia Rodrigo’s stylists, Chloe and Chenelle Delgadillo, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>started a partnership</a> with the brand, and Sarah Jessica Parker wore a pair of Claire’s stud earrings in And Just Like That. Even Khloe Kardashian is a frequent shopper.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-puma></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_81-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Puma</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_82-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Theo Wargo/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_83-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Puma was a force of sneaker culture in the early aughts, with the Speedcat sneaker being one of its most popular styles. The brand now carries a whole collection of the classic sneaker, which was launched in 1998. While Puma is a sportswear brand often worn by athletes, the brand also collaborates with a variety of other celebrities, including Rihanna and Dua Lipa.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK572GuiZp6RqLWqu81mmauZnpnAboSScWlwcWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
