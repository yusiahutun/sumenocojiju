After A Christmas Story, he went on to land small parts on shows such as Punky Brewster (1985-86), Highway to Heaven (1985) and The Wonder Years (1993). In 1994, he earned an Emmy nomination for The Writing on the Wall, a CBS Schoolbreak Special about antisemitism.</p><p>As Billingsley got older, he turned to work behind the camera, winning an Emmy nomination as the co-executive producer on the IFC talk show Dinner for Five (2001), hosted by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jon Favreau</a>. Billingsley had a bit part in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Aniston</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vince Vaughn</a>’s The Break-Up (2006), a film on which he also served as executive producer.

When Dillon passed away in January 2023 at the age of 83, Billingsley paid tribute to her on Instagram. “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">She was kind, supportive, cool, thoughtful, giving and committed</a>,” he wrote. “I feel so fortunate to have had the opportunity to call her my on-screen mother.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Darren McGavin as The Old Man Parker</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/3-6.png><p>Ralphie’s dad was played by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Darren McGavin</a>, a TV actor best known for starring as the lead in Mickey Spillane’s Mike Hammer in the late ’50s, as well as the title character in 1974’s Kolchak: The Night Stalker series, a short-lived cult hit.</p><p>He also appeared in films such as Airport ’77 (1977) and Disney’s Hot Lead and Cold Feet (1978).
