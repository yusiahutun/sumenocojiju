He’s perhaps best known for his roles as Shane on Max’s Minx and as Marco Valentin Pena in the two sequels of Netflix’s The Kissing Booth. On August 14, 2022, Taylor shared to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>TikTok</a> that filming had wrapped filming on Red, White and Royal Blue, much to the excitement of his followers.&nbsp;</p><p>Taylor, who is of Mexican, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean descent, told <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Sharp Magazine</a> in 2021 that he had noticed a “troubling” trend among casting directors in Hollywood. “They want someone who’s Cuban-specific or Mexican-specific, and you’re like, ‘Okay, great.’ But when you get into the minutia of their skin color, they’ll say, ‘We need someone darker. This Latin actor is not brown enough.’ It’s very unsettling because I would hate the industry to start saying Latin is [only] dark-brown skin and black hair,” he explains. “I feel like, once they start understanding that we are so diverse, we just need more BIPOC folks in positions of power to make these decisions and let fewer non-BIPOC people speak for them.”</p><p>In an interview with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Newsweek</a>&nbsp;in August 2023, Taylor-Zakhar Perez opened up about the popularity of the book and how he landed the role. “I hadn’t heard of the book or read the book before the audition came. I think a friend of mine auditioned or something, and he sent it to me. He’s like, ‘Hey, have you got this audition?’ And I said, ‘No, I don’t know what that is.’”</p><p>He continued, “He’s like, ‘Well, here’s the book, I think they’re gonna start casting it.’ So I started to read it, and it was an incredible book. I really didn’t have any idea that it was so popular until I started telling people that I might be going to England for a project, and everybody was freaking out. Even my publicist was like, ‘Oh, my God, I read that during COVID. It’s an amazing book.’ I really didn’t know the magnitude of it.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.4688940092166><h2>Who plays Prince Henry in Red, White and Royal Blue?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Red-White-Royal-Blue-9.jpg><p>Nicholas Galitzine has been cast as Prince Henry in&nbsp;Red, White and Royal Blue. This is actually Galitzine’s second time playing a prince—after starring in 2021’s Cinderella opposite Camila Cabello—and his second time working alongside Uma Thurman, who plays President Ellen Claremont. “She played my mother [on Chambers], and now she’s playing Taylor’s mom. So we have this weird, shared, very niche bond that not many people can claim,” Galitzine told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a>.</p><p>“The incredible thing about the project is that I’ve never been involved with something that has this built-in fan base straight from the beginning. … The amount of support that Taylor Zakhar Perez and I received from the outset has just been overwhelming.

I cannot wait to be on our Oval Office set with her.”&nbsp;</p><p>In a past interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a> in 2008, the Kill Bill star said: “I’m very choosy about everything I do — and also very lucky.” Indeed, it echoes what she told Another Magazine that same year: “My need to do it is strong. But it’s hard to find the right project.”</p><p>In an interview with the Los Angeles Public Library, author Casey McQuiston described the character Thurman will embody:&nbsp;“Most of my characters are pulled from a mixture of my brain, people I know, people from history, and tropes I love, but Ellen Claremont, in particular, was heavily inspired by a real-life Texas Democrat: Wendy Davis. I’ll never forget watching Wendy filibuster for abortion rights on the floor of the Texas State Senate for eleven hours straight, and when I was coming up with what I pictured for a first female president, that was the first image that came to mind.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Who plays the King in Red, White and Royal Blue?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1258869742.jpg><p>Iconic British actor and TV personality Stephen Fry plays the King.

In an interview with Hello in 2019, Mcquiston, however, revealed that a sequel is “possible.” “Anything’s possible,” they said. “I will say that I have plenty of ideas for stories set in this world and would love a chance to explore one of them someday. I would be surprised if you’ve seen the last of Alex and Henry.”</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfp7KledahoK2dXae8uq3LZpmlrZVisKK%2F02g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
