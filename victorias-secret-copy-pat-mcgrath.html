It all started on Monday night when Instagram user <strong>@diet_prada</strong> shared a side-by-side photo of Victoria’s Secret’s new fragrance ornaments, which appears to be heavily influenced by the Pat McGrath Labs sequin packaging. In fact, they look nearly identical.</p><p>“In 2017, women are not shopping&nbsp;<a class=notranslate href=# rel=nofollow>@victoriassecret</a>&nbsp;the way they used to. They’re still offering padded bras, airbrushing, and ill-advised ‘tribal’ runway looks to a world of women who are increasingly questioning the status quo,” said&nbsp;@diet_prada. “Another new strategy – knocking off the mythical goddess&nbsp;<a class=notranslate href=# rel=nofollow>@patmcgrathreal</a>&nbsp;and her instantly iconic makeup packaging. Hey VS – the way to win women back is DEFINITELY not by copying them.”</p><p>Soon after, followers echoed the caption with their own unfiltered commentary. “Yaaaassssssss!!!! I saw this and instantly thought knock off!! The&nbsp;<a class=notranslate href=# rel=nofollow>@patmcgrathreal</a>&nbsp;packaging in Sephora was so good last year. This cheap knock off version is lame,” said one commenter.</p><p>Another said, “Also been wondering when they would stop doing tribal looks in their shows. I think they are trying to justify it by hiring models of color. But at the end of the day just because someone isnt white doesnt mean they are from a particular “tribe” or automatically are allowed to wear feather headresses or knock offs of tribal prints and painting.”</p><p>Eventually, McGrath herself caught wind of the post and wrote,&nbsp;“😱😱😱😱I LOVE UOOOO @diet_prada ⚡️⚡️⚡️❤️❤️❤️😍.”</p><p>We eagerly await Victoria’s Secret’s response because this tea is piping hot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2hvYGuDd36Or6CcrJ%2BntqK%2FjKycnKqVqXqku8%2ByZKmZpGK6pLPRmquhZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
