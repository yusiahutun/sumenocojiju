Remembering the ‘toughest time’ of his life, Hugh explained that his mother moved back to England, leaving him and his four siblings alone with their father in Sydney.</p><p>Hugh recalled: “At the time, it was difficult. One of the main things I remember is that horrible feeling that people were talking about you and looking at you because it was odd for the mother to leave. For many years, I thought it was not going to be forever, so I clung to that. Up until about the age of 12 or 13, I thought Mum and Dad would get back together.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hugh-jackman-s-healing-journey>Hugh Jackman’s healing journey</h2><p>Hugh Jackman admitted that the journey to the healing took years and finally when he started his own family, it helped him understand his own mother better. The actor gushed, “I think having kids of your own just adds another level of empathy and understanding. And there comes a certain point in life when you have to stop blaming other people for how you feel or the misfortunes in your life.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-as-parents-we-make-mistakes>“As parents, we make mistakes”</h2><p>Hugh Jackman’s humane take on parenting is really heartwarming to hear as he talked about how children realize that parents can also make mistakes when they have healed from their childhood trauma.</p><p>The actor shared: “I’ve spoken about it at length with her since and I know she was struggling. She was in hospital after I was born suffering from post-natal depression.</p><p>“And then you add five kids into the mix and the fact she had emigrated from England and there wasn’t a support network for her here, plus the fact that Dad was at work all day — and you realise that as parents we make mistakes.”</p><p>For more Celebrity Tidbits stories, follow us on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Facebook</a>.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2eCcLTUoJ9mopGYuK6tzWarqKebYsamrdGsZK2nXZ2yoriMn6mopV2pv6LBzJpkoZ1dm66kscNmmK1lmqrAtXmXZrCemaKoerC4w2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
