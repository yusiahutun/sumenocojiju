But if you have naturally curly strands, this is a great way to keep your hair texture looking its best.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Curl training is restoring and reforming one's natural curl memory," shares Samaria. "[It's] refining and embracing one's curl memory to give the hair a more consistent look. You'll have more body and a more polished, cohesive look."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-i-curl-train-my-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Do I Curl Train My Hair?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One great aspect of curl training is there are a plethora of ways to do it. It all just comes down to what's best for your particular hair texture and type. But first thing's first: It's very important to avoid using heat if you're looking to restore your curl pattern. Treatments such as coloring, relaxing, and even using keratin can also hold your hair back.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The most important foundational factor would be to begin with a haircut," the stylist explains. "Getting rid of any unhealthy hair will help embrace and encourage any curl to form. A haircut will also increase volume and add body to the hair."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Next, you'll need to invest in hydrating wash day products. Samaria is a fan of BREAD's line of products, which are specifically formulated for natural hair, including the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">hair-wash</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow">hair-mask</a>. We also love <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Pattern's Hydrating Shampoo</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>Leave-In Conditioner</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While cleansing your hair is essential, when it comes to curl training and restoration, how you style your hair is actually the most important step.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You can style your hair into two-strand twists or braids to add and balance your curls, if your hair lives within the 4 family," explains Samaria. "If your hair lives within the 3s, after applying product, brush through small sections and refine each curl with a Denman brush. You can also finger twist hair strands, setting curls in smaller sections of hair with product for any curly hair type to help restore curls and embrace curl memory."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: The Best Hot Oil Treatments You Didn't Know Your Natural Hair Needed</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-can-curl-training-actually-reverse-heat-damage></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Can Curl Training Actually Reverse Heat Damage?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Technically, no.
