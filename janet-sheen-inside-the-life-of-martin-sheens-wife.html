However, she is famous as Martin Sheen’s wife. Born Ramón Antonio Gerardo Estévez, Martin Sheen is an American actor. He has received numerous accolades in his six-decade career, including three Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and four Screen Actors Guild Awards.&nbsp;</p><p>Martin is renowned for his role as U.S. President Josiah Bartlet in the NBC series “The West Wing” from 1999-2006. Although Martin has one of the most extensive careers in Hollywood, his relationship with his wife is equally long-lasting. Consequently, fans are curious about the legendary actor’s partner. So, who is Martin Sheen’s wife?</p><p>Here’s everything about Janet Sheen and her relationship with the actor.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-14_10-26-25-fotor-20230814103139.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Janet_Sheen></span>Who Is Janet Sheen?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The renowned actress was born Janet Templeton in Dayton, Ohio, United States, on July 8, 1944. However, despite being a successful actress, Janet Sheen has kept details about her early life and upbringing private. Consequently, there are no details regarding the identity of her parents and siblings, if any.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to her stringently private life, details about her early educational achievements and background also elude the media. However, after graduating high school, she enrolled at the New School for Social Research in New York City, where she studied art.</p><p>Like Janet Sheen, Martin was also born to his parents, Mary-Ann and Francisco Estévez Martínez, in Dayton, Ohio, on August 3, 1940. However, both of Martin’s parents were immigrants. While his mother was Irish, from Borrisokane, County Tipperary, his father was Spanish and was born in Salceda de Caselas, Galicia.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Janet_Sheen_Meet_Her_Husband></span>How Did Janet Sheen Meet Her Husband?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While Janet Sheen hasn’t revealed much about her relationship with Martin, the iconic actor, on the other hand, recounts how they met every chance he gets. In an interview, Martin revealed that he moved to New York City in 1959 to pursue a career in theater. However, he met Janet the following year, in 1960, while sleeping on a friend’s couch.</p><p>At the time, Janet Sheen was an art student at the New School for Social Research. Shortly after they met, the two began dating. In a 2022 interview, Martin spoke of his time in New York. He said those years were vital in his life as he experienced immense growth and met his wife.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-14_10-26-33-fotor-20230814103115.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Did_Janet_Sheen_Tie_the_Knot></span>When Did Janet Sheen Tie the Knot?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Shortly after the lovebirds met in 1960, they began dating. While dating, the two moved in together and tied the knot after Janet became pregnant on December 23, 1961. In his dual memoir, “Along the Way: The Journey of a Father and Son,” Janet Sheen’s husband revealed that although they were both young, starting a family seemed natural. Hence, the couple exchanged vows a year after they met in a short, 15-minute ceremony in New York.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Children_Does_Martin_Sheens_Wife_Have></span>How Many Children Does Martin Sheen’s Wife Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Janet Sheen and her famous husband have four children. Less than six months after tying the knot, Janet and Martin became parents for the first time. They welcomed their first child and son, Emilio Estévez, in May 1962. The following year, the couple welcomed their second child and son, Ramon Estévez, on August 7, 1963.</p><p>In addition, the couple had their third and youngest son, Carlos Estévez, famously known as <a href=#>Charlie Sheen</a> and the most famous of the siblings, on September 3, 1965. Two years later, Janet Sheen and her husband welcomed their fourth child and only daughter, Renée Estévez. She was born on April 2, 1967.</p><p>Since Janet Sheen’s husband pursued a career in Hollywood, travel was a big part of life for the family. Hence, it’s no surprise that all four of their children followed in their famous father’s footsteps, with Emilio and Charlie becoming household names in their own right.</p><p>However, of Janet’s children, Charlie is the only one who professionally adopted the Sheen stage name. In addition, Janet Sheen and Martin’s family has continued to grow. They now have ten grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-14_10-25-48-fotor-20230814103217.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Janet_Sheen_Movies_and_TV_Shows></span>Janet Sheen Movies and TV Shows<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As stated earlier, Janet is an actress and has worked on several projects.
