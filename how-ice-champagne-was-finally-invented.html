Pommery claimed that drinkers of its new, ice-friendly Royal Blue Sky would be “quickly hypnotized by this wine, that you want to discover as soon as possible.” Veuve Clicquot, a sister brand to Moët under the LVMH umbrella, went even farther, suggesting its “rich” offshoot be served over ice, in cocktails, or swirled with a chunk of pineapple, some cucumber, or even a squirt of tea.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It wasn’t just the Champagne houses eyeing a share of this sparkling market, either. There are now around a dozen ice-friendly, new blends from French winemakers, such as Bordeaux-based JP Chenet and Jura-based Francois Montand, which has been using méthode champenoise since its namesake winemaker fled there during World War II. There’s a similar aesthetic—foil-wrapped or frosted bottles with snazzy, busy graphics—and a marketing programme that’s more Kendall ’n’ Gigi than Catherine Deneuve. Moët Ice free-flowing at Coachella this year and name-checked in ample Instagrams was a result.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But how and why have the Champagne houses shucked off traditional constraints and launched these poppy, seemingly sacrilegious blends? It’s down to tradition, taste, and conveniently coinciding trends.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Much as marketers might suggest that the idea of icing champagne is outré or unexpected, it’s a long-time habit in France, especially in the south, according to Champagne expert Caroline Brun, who works with such brands as Bollinger.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In St. Tropez, people have been drinking Champagne [this way] since the 1960s. It’s a fresher way to drink champagne, which, as you know, can be enjoyed anywhere, anytime,” she told Bloomberg via email. “It’s as simple as that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/08/24/5aa4b2ea-872a-11e7-8f03-5f0754277a16_600x_175032.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Indeed, ice Champagne’s implicit association with the yacht- and model-heavy life of a mogul in St. Tropez has earned it the nickname ‘Disco Champagne.’ Quaffing it this way implicitly transports the drinker poolside, somewhere with jet-set je ne sais quoi; no wonder serving Champagne in a goblet with a few ice cubes is known in France as à la piscine, or “swimming pool style.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Piper-Heidsieck was the first Champagne brand to try to import this tradition stateside a decade ago, with its Piscine programme, which emphasised oversized glasses, but according to Brun, kept the recipe of the Champagne the same. “It was just a campaign for a glass with their normal cuvée.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Moët entirely reformulated its juice for Ice Imperial. When food or drink is consumed at colder temperatures, sugars are less prominent, so it’s perceived to be less sweet. This quirk makes brand extensions aimed à la piscine a handy way to repackage, and so re-popularise, the sweeter Champagnes whose flavour has fallen from favour. (Longtime Champagne champ stateside for Moët was its sweet White Star expression, but in 2012, LVMH discontinued distribution in the US) Ice Imperial, with 45 gm of sugar per litre, is technically a demi sec, while Veuve Rich’s 60g earn it the traditional doux classification — the closest Champagne can come to fizzy candy. It’s a stark contrast with brut Champagne, arguably the standard flavor profile today; with a maximum 12g per litre or dosage, it’s 80 per cent less sweet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/08/24/5b259504-872a-11e7-8f03-5f0754277a16_1320x770_175032.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are other advantages to channelling the insouciance of the south of France in midsummer. Clicquot and company clearly hope these new brand extensions can emulate another product with similar associations: rosé wine, which has gone from poolside plonk to permanent tabletop fixture in the last decade, thanks to some canny marketing. Today, the rosé market worldwide is now estimated to be worth US$389 million, with the US and France accounting for 50 per cent of it. Rosé has become synonymous year-round with high-living jet-setters, a glimpse of summer in a glass, given birth to its own hashtags (#roseallday), lifestyle brands, and generation-defining colour (millennial pink).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The iced Champagne makers are hoping their new category will pop in much the same way. They’re also pricing it at a premium: Expect to pay around US$10 more for the Ice version versus Imperial’s standard edition; Veuve Rich is also pricier than the company’s ubiquitous Brut. Certainly, the market is fizzing. Sparkling wine is one of the three fastest-growing wine categories worldwide — global consumption as a whole is projected to increase 8.7 per cent by 2019 — while stateside Champagne imports have increased every year for the last four years. (Figures for ice Champagne are not broken out by umbrella organisation CIVC because “the consumption mode is not one of the criteria upon which the growers and houses declare the volumes that they have produced,” says Communications Director Thibaut Le Mailloux.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/08/24/5acf18a0-872a-11e7-8f03-5f0754277a16_600x_175032.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This new niche of sparkling wines also launched at a timely moment in craft cocktailing, according to Charlotte Voisey from drinks firm William Grant & Sons. Bartenders have been enthusiastically rediscovering European-style café cocktails such as the Aperol spritz. Lower-alcohol recipes have become staples at most cocktail bars over the last three years and, as with rosé, are associated with unabashed day drinking. This year, for example, New York’s award-winning Dante bar was one of several spots to declare 2017 the Summer of Spritz.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The whole spritz phenomenon has just blown up, and the Aperol spritz definitely paved the way,” says Voisey by phone from her office in New York. “Now people try to order spritzes without knowing exactly what they are—they just know they’re supposed to order them. It’s perfect for summer: a bubbly wine drink, thrown over ice in a lovely wine glass.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">How handy, then, that Champagne makers suggest drinking these brand extensions in exactly the same goblet-style coupes in which Venetians traditionally served their prosecco-based spritz. It doesn’t hurt that the serving sizes are heftier than a traditional flute, so you’ll power through a bottle of Ice faster than its old-school counterpart.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bartender and writer Jeffrey Morgenthaler agrees that it has become much easier to persuade drinkers to try these new Champagnes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“That whole category of drinks is very much about sparkling wine being served over ice, so it’s not even a slight misstep to do it,” he explains by phone from his bar, Clyde Common, in Portland, Ore. The new iced Champagne category, though, confuses Morgenthaler.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The Champagne companies are always like this,” he says. “They want to be hip and relevant, but they don’t want to contaminate the culture of Champagne, so they make these very weak steps, like putting Champagne in tiny bottles with a straw. And it’s so funny, because Champagne doesn’t need a gimmick. It’s awesome, the best alcoholic beverage out there—better than gin or whisky.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Writer and veteran bartender Angus Winchester is more blunt: “It’s just an example of bandwagon-jumping by the French drink makers. I’m not a fan and can’t see them surviving long, thank God.” Just keep your eyes out for what Gigi’s drinking at Coachella ’18.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZq2qkauyrXnFqKadZ5Gnwaqvy55ma2lgbX51gY6hprBlmZiybq%2FHmqSpmZejsm7DwKxkn6GelrmtxYyipa%2BdnqmypQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
