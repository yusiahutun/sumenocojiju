I've never been on a film set like this before. I'd been on a film set twice before then, and I'm now on a film set completely naked with all of these people, and I don't know what I'm meant to do and I don't know what's expected of me, and I don't know what you want and I don't know what I want," she explained.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:4e3c9908-ec71-5b32-b973-d9c07d6f6e71 data-container-ref=toofab:article:951690ec-0caa-5389-9e5e-da91aefce3d0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e4/5by4/2019/11/07/e4c006e44a875dea8cb4f366b5c452ce_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">CBS</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jason Momoa Tries to Shoot An Apple Off James Corden's Head While Blindfolded</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>She confessed she wasn't aware at first of the level of nudity written in the scripts, as she was focused on the fact she had just landed a major acting gig.</p><p>"I took the job and then they sent me the scripts and I was reading them, and I was, like, 'Oh, there's the catch!'" she remembered. "But I'd come fresh from drama school, and I approached [it] as a job -- if it's in the script, then it's clearly needed, this is what this is, and I'm gonna make sense of it. Everything's gonna be cool."</p><p>But the awkwardness of nude scenes was only heightened as first job jitters and self doubt crept in.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:bbc09da0-6b6b-5285-a892-794c128225ba data-container-ref=toofab:article:951690ec-0caa-5389-9e5e-da91aefce3d0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/9b/5by4/2019/10/23/9b0b326424d65167bffb487eb4899b1a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">HBO/Helen Sloan</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Full Game of Thrones Script Explains Why Daenerys Burned King's Landing ...

Whatever I'm feeling is wrong, I'm gonna cry in the bathroom and then I'm gonna come back and we're gonna do the scene and it's gonna be completely fine."</p><p>Emilia finally found comfort when doing scenes with <a href=#><strong>Jason Momoa</strong></a>, who played her on screen love interest, because he was so supportive in her creating boundaries for how and when she would appear nude.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a6fc36ce-7250-5f70-96bd-6fbd59f9b513 data-container-ref=toofab:article:951690ec-0caa-5389-9e5e-da91aefce3d0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/93/5by4/2019/10/31/93ac271c70fa526c862c5be718fcf00f_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">NBC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Emilia Clarke Cracks Case, Reveals ‘Game of Thrones’ True Coffee Cup Culprit</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"It was definitely hard," she said. "Which is why the scenes, when I got to do them with Jason, were wonderful, because he was like, 'No, sweetie, this isn't OK.' And I was like, 'Ohhhh.'"</p><p>Now the actress feels more empowered to take a stand as she recalled being asked to do a nude scene for a different project when she hadn't agreed to in advance.</p><p>"I'm a lot more savvy with what I'm comfortable with, and what I am OK with doing," Emilia explained. "I've had fights on set before where I'm like, 'No, the sheet stays up', and they're like, 'You don't wanna disappoint your 'Game of Thrones' fans.' And I'm like, 'F--k you.'"</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
