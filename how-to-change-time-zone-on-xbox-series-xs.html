But luckily, the process is quite simple. So if you're looking to change your time zone on Xbox Series X|S, we can help.</p><h2 id=what-are-the-time-settings-on-xbox-series-x-s>What Are the Time Settings on Xbox Series X|S?</h2><p>While self-explanatory, the <strong>Time</strong> settings on Xbox Series X|S do more than simply alter the time zone used by your Xbox. And if you rely on public holidays or calendar changes throughout the year, the <strong>Time</strong> settings also accommodate them, as long as you have set your Xbox to the correct region.</p><p>In this way, setting the correct region on Xbox Series X|S dictates the default <strong>Time</strong> settings your Xbox will use, and all the available options for <strong>Time</strong> will adjust accordingly. So you may need to <a href=#>change your Xbox Series X|S region</a> before continuing to change your time zone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/xbox-power-button.jpg><p>But specifically, the <strong>Time</strong> settings on your Xbox allow for three main settings to be adjusted and altered to your preference, including your time zone. These settings can be defined by the following:</p><ul><li>Using the <strong>Automatically adjust for daylight saving</strong> option to have your Xbox follow your local daylight savings time adjustments or not.</li><li>Deciding whether your Xbox utilizes a <strong>24-hour clock</strong> or not.</li><li>Changing your <strong>Time zone</strong> to alter the default time used by your Xbox to a different area.</li></ul><p>However, while these settings are easy to access and can be adjusted at any time, there are still a few pieces of information you may need to be aware of before altering any of these settings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-you-need-to-know-about-changing-time-zone-on-xbox>What You Need to Know About Changing Time Zone on Xbox</h2><p>The last few important things to know before you change your time zone on Xbox are how altering the setting will affect your console, and what you may need to do to ensure that your Time zone is changed successfully.</p><p>The most information you may need to know before changing your time zone or any other option within the Time settings for your Xbox is as follows:</p><ul><li>It is best to alter the <strong>Time</strong> settings on your Xbox while disconnected from the Xbox network. This guarantees your choices won't be overwritten by Internet preferences.</li><li>Changing your time zone may not alter the in-game time for all games, especially if the game you're playing runs off its own online services, like live service Xbox games.</li><li>Altering your time zone can affect when the <strong>Shutdown</strong> power option attempts to save energy by updating at night. Changing when your console recognizes night would interfere with energy saving, and you may need to <a href=#>adjust your Xbox Series X|S power settings</a> accordingly.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-2855.jpg><p>Even though some of the above annoyances can distract from the reason you may want to adjust your time zone on Xbox, you can still get around any potential issues and continue on to alter your <strong>Time</strong> settings.</p><h2 id=how-to-customize-your-time-settings-on-xbox-series-x-s>How to Customize Your Time Settings on Xbox Series X|S</h2><p>Now you know all the key bits of information regarding the Time settings on Xbox, you're ready to adjust the time zone of your Xbox Series X|S.

Unlike the region of your console, however, you can only change the region of your Xbox account no more than once every three months. Because of this, you must be certain you want to adjust the region of your account before finalizing the change.</p><h3>Q: How Do You Change Your Time Zone on Xbox Series X|S to Play Games Early?</h3><p>By entering the <strong>System</strong> settings of your Xbox and selecting <strong>Language & location</strong>, you can change the region of your Xbox Series X|S. If a game is supposed to be released early in the region you selected, you will be able to purchase and play games from that region's Xbox Store earlier than your own time zone. However, aside from accessing games early via another region, you can officially <a href=#>play supported Xbox games early through Xbox Game Preview</a> from any region.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3>Q: Will Your Xbox Series X|S Console Work in Other Time Zones?</h3><p>In short, because every Xbox Series X|S console is region-free, you can use your Xbox Series X or Series S in any country or time zone without any issues. While there may be issues when it comes to cable compatibility, especially if you're traveling to the US from the UK, for instance, as soon as your Xbox is set up, it will be running just as if you were using it within your own time zone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGifqK9dqbxur8eapaCdXam2rrGMs6annV2ku27EwaivZquVp7amv4yxqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
