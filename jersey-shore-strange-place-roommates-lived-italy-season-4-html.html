After Florence approved their stay, Salsano needed to find living quarters for the roommates.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-jersey-shore-cast-stayed-in-a-bank-outfitted-for-reality-tv>‘Jersey Shore’ cast stayed in a bank outfitted for reality TV&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-5_33>During a 2019 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bustle</a>, Salsano revealed the cast didn’t stay in a house during their time in Italy. They didn’t even live in a residency —&nbsp;the Jersey Shore&nbsp;roommates lived in a bank.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2 readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/JENNIWOWW/status/1403153003729850369</p></figure><p id=par-6_53>“We couldn’t find a place that could house us that was in the city that had outdoor space,” Salsano told the outlet. “That location [we filmed in was] actually a bank.” As Salsano recalls, the bank had no showers or kitchen and needed to be retrofit to meet the needs of the&nbsp;<a href=#>Jersey Shore&nbsp;cast</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_64>“Some walls that were layout walls — like the one Mike rammed his head into — were concrete walls that obviously we couldn’t move,” she adds. “But the truth of the matter is, we had to take that entire place and lay it out.” Working with local contractors, MTV’s art department transformed the financial institution into a “home” for the cast of Jersey Shore.</p><h2 id=h-jersey-shore-season-4-patio-was-made-of-scaffolding>‘Jersey Shore’ Season 4 patio was made of scaffolding</h2><p id=par-8_38>The&nbsp;cast’s Italian bank villa included an outdoor patio. Most of the <a href=#>Jersey Shore roommates</a> spent plenty of time out there hanging out or smoking. You can see it at the 53-minute mark in this supercut of season 4.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_53>Like so much of their living quarters, production crews had the deck patio constructed for filming. “That was all scaffolding, none of that was there,” Salsano tells Bustle. “We built scaffolding in the inside of the building to make it seem like there was a courtyard up there. There was nothing up there.”</p><p id=par-10_51>As for accessing said patio, that was a window. “If you go back and you watch them actually walking down the hallway and how they got outside, that was not a door they were going to; it was a f—— window,” Salsano adds. You can see this window in the supercut.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_40>“In the hallway, there was a window, and we built stairs going up to the window like it was normal,” she concludes. “So if you look at it now, you’d be like, ‘Oh my god, that was such a window.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3pr7SnrBmq5ikv6Z50q2pmqaXmnqxuMCcnGaqn6S6rq3TnqpmpJmrsqV5yK2YpbFdqLKiv86nZG1mmKm6rXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
