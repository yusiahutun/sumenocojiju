The album—also titled Act I: Renaissance—is the first act of a trilogy project Beyoncé started during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Creating this album allowed me a place to dream and to find escape during a scary time for the world. It allowed me to feel free and adventurous in a time when little else was moving,” Beyoncé explained in an Instagram post on June 30, 2022. “My intention was to create a safe place, a place without judgment. A place to be free of perfectionism and overthinking. A place to scream, release, feel freedom. It was a beautiful journey of exploration. I hope you find joy in this music. I hope it inspires you to release the wiggle. Ha! And to feel as unique, strong, and sexy as you are.”</p><p>Renaissance&nbsp;features 16 songs including lead single “Break My Soul,” which peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as tracks like “Energy,” “Virgo’s Groove” and “Summer Renaissance.” Beyoncé confirmed her seventh studio album was in the works in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Harper’s Bazaar</a> in April 2021, where she explained that the LP was inspired by her feelings throughout the pandemic. “With all the isolation and injustice over the past year, I think we are all ready to escape, travel, love, and laugh again. I feel a renaissance emerging, and I want to be part of nurturing that escape in any way possible,” she said at the time. “I’ve been in the studio for a year and a half. Sometimes it takes a year for me to personally search through thousands of sounds to find just the right kick or snare. One chorus can have up to 200 stacked harmonies. Still, there’s nothing like the amount of love, passion, and healing that I feel in the recording studio. After 31 years, it feels just as exciting as it did when I was nine years old. Yes, the music is coming!”</p><p>In a post on her website in July 2022, Beyoncé dedicated her album to her husband, Jay-Z; three kids, Rumi, Sir and Blue; and her uncle Johnny, her late first cousin, as well as other members of her family. “I want to give a special thank you to Rumi, Sir, and Blue for allowing me the space, creativity, and inspiration. And a special thanks to my beautiful husband and muse, who held me down during those late nights in the studio. A big thank you to my Uncle Johnny,” she wrote. “He was my godmother and the first person to expose me to a lot of the music and culture that serve as inspiration for this album. Thank you to all of the pioneers who originate culture, to all of the fallen angels whose contributions have gone unrecognized for far too long. This is a celebration for you. Thank you to my Parkwood crew, my slab, Dream, and all of the talented producers involved. Mama, I luhhhh you. To my father, my O.G., my first teacher: You inspire me in every move that I make. I love you.” See Beyoncé’s full Renaissance track list below.</p><li>“I’m That Girl”</li><li>“Cozy”</li><li>“Alien Superstar”</li><li>“Cuff It”</li><li>“Energy” featuring Beam</li><li>“Break My Soul”</li><li>“Church Girl”</li><li>“Plastic Off the Sofa”</li><li>“Virgo’s Groove”</li><li>“Move” featuring Grace Jones and Tema</li><li>“Heated”</li><li>“Thique”</li><li>“All Up in Your Mind”</li><li>“America Has a Problem”</li><li>“Pure/Honey”</li><li>“Summer Renaissance”</li><p>It’s also assumed that Beyoncé Renaissance World Tour set list will include songs from her 2023 concert at Atlantis The Royal Resort in Dubai, United Arab Emirates on January 21, 2023, which included both new and old hits from the singer.

Tina, “She stays up late reviewing tapes, studying them to make it better. It’s hard for me — it’s one of the reasons I go on tour. I’m always the person to make her go to bed. I’m still her mother, so I can walk up and close the computer and tell her to go to bed,” she said.</p><p>Tina recalled a time when Beyoncé was 15 years old and she took her and the other members of Destiny’s Child to see Janet Jackson live in concert. “The others were like, ‘That was great,'” Tina remembered “But Beyoncé was already pulling it apart, trying to figure out what made it good. She said, ‘One day I want to have a concert like that.'”</p><p>Beyoncé also told Marie Claire about the meaning behind her 2008 hit single “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It).” “I just try to write songs that people are going to have a dialogue about. Songs that people are going to feel . . . at dinner, at the club. I want people to have some type of emotion,” Beyoncé said before explaining the meaning behind “Single Ladies.” “More than anything, the song celebrates being single. It’s like, if you’ve been doing all you can and it’s not happening for you, go out and have you a good old time. Put on your sexy dress and move on.”</p><p>Beyoncé also told Marie Claire about her on-stage alter ego Sasha Fierce and the personality is reflected in her music. “I know I’m stronger in the songs than I really am,” she said. “Sometimes I need to hear it myself. We all need to hear those empowering songs to remind us.”</p><p>She also told the magazine about how she and her husband, Jay-Z, keep their relationship strong despite their busy careers. “We try to sync our calendars,” Beyoncé said. “I started working on my tour a year ago just to make sure that I had time at home. But you know, that’s part of it. Any other woman who has to go to work and pick up the kids and make dinner—that’s way harder than what I have to do. At least I can say I’m taking two weeks off and really take two weeks off.” As for how she predicted her life would change after her past tour at the time, Beyoncé told Marie Claire, “My priorities are slowly changing. So after this tour I might be tired and want to take two years off. I’ve worked hard enough to be able to do that. I’m in a very good place.”</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Beyoncé tickets to the Renaissance World Tour are available on <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2>StubHub</span></a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2>Vivid Seats</span></a>.
