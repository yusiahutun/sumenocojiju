Not only is this DIY treatment easy and affordable, but the results are also chilling (in a good way). Tutorials of people using ice cubes, ice rollers, and globes have recently taken over <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>#SkinTok</a>, however, the ritual has been used in spas (read: cryotherapy, CoolSculpting, and spider vein removal) and has been a mainstay in cultures like Korea for several years. Ahead, we tapped skincare experts who break down the benefits — and risks — of icing your face, plus the right way to do it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep scrolling to learn what icing does to your face and whether it's right for you.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-the-benefits-of-icing-your-face></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are the Benefits of Icing Your Face?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Icing has been popular for decades in many cultures to tighten skin, reduce redness, and reduce inflammation, which contributes to facial swelling," confirms <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Karan Lal</a>, a board-certified dermatologist. "It's becoming popular because it's easy, cheap, and relatively safe."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-who-should-ice-their-face></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Who Should Ice Their Face?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Good news: Anyone can ice their skin. Dr. Lal says the treatment is safe for all skin types and tones. You can apply ice cubes, ice rollers, or cryo globes to your face daily, just be sure to not leave them on your skin for prolonged periods. Prolonged use can lead to inflammation of fat (panniculitis) or dyspigmentation in the skin — especially in people of color, warns Dr. Lal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Also, don't forget to clean any tools that you use to avoid spreading bacteria. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Morgan Rackley</a>, a licensed esthetician and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Luminous Skin Atlanta</a>, recommends wiping them down with 70% alcohol after each use.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-the-results-of-icing-your-skin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are The Results of Icing Your Skin?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even better news: Icing your face delivers instant results, albeit temporary ones. However, this makes it a quick and easy treatment to do before heading to an important event.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The use of ice rollers or ice packs works quickly and effectively at reducing swelling, pore size, and redness. However, this is a transient effect of cold therapy," Dr. Lal explains. "Redness and skin laxity will return as the skin adjusts back to normal temperatures."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-the-difference-between-using-ice-cubes-ice-rollers-and-cryo-globes></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's the Difference Between Using Ice Cubes, Ice Rollers, and Cryo Globes?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The tool you use to ice your face mostly comes down to personal preference, but there isn't too much of a difference in the results they provide. "There is no difference between <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>jade rollers</a> (placed in the fridge) or ice rollers per se in terms of effectiveness, but ice rollers often are made of metal which can conduct cold better than jade and are more likely to cause side effects with prolonged application," Dr. Lal tells us.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-the-best-method-for-icing-your-face></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's the Best Method for Icing Your Face?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rackley suggests starting with clean, hydrated skin. "Then, use the cold roller over skin starting from the center of the face and rolling out to the perimeter," she says. "This is a great <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>lymphatic drainage</a> moment."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-skincare-products-should-i-use-after-icing-my-face></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Skincare Products Should I Use After Icing My Face?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"After you have calmed and cooled the skin with your ice roller or cool globe, you'll want to top it off with any serum or moisturizer that is hydrating, healing, or plumping to give the skin a nice glow," Rackley says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for what products to avoid, Dr. Lal cautions against using any acids post-icing session since your pores will be closed and this could lead to irritation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And if you're icing your face in the morning, you can apply makeup afterward. In fact, the treatment can make your makeup look better. "It's the perfect time to follow up with your makeup as your pores will appear smaller and your skin will look and feel firmer, so your makeup will lay better," says Rackley."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-should-you-see-a-dermatologist></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When Should You See a Dermatologist?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Again, icing your face produces only temporary results. "This is not a long-term solution for treating skin issues and seeking care from a dermatologist is necessary to address these issues in a more permanent fashion," says Dr. Lal.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faqs-47f71fbf-9979-4b3f-acf7-56a29bd773c3></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=50><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How long should I ice my face?</span></p><p>If you're icing your entire face, do not spend more than 15 minutes, and do not hold the ice for too long against one area but rather continually move it all around.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=2 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Can icing my face improve acne?</span></p><p>Icing your face may help to remove any pain and swelling associated with an inflamed pimple, however, it will not remove the pimple.
