Her struggles with getting sober were well-documented in an <a href=# rel=nofollow>Oprah series</a>&nbsp;in 2014, along with many <a href=# rel=nofollow>splashy headlines</a> over the years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lindsay-lohan-1.jpg><p>Regardless of—or perhaps thanks to—her past, it&nbsp;seems as though she’s already getting started on cultivating those guru vibes. For example, she tells the publication that she has no regrets: “I&nbsp;wouldn’t call things regrets, per se. I can’t turn back time. But if I could, I would have listened more to my mother and gone back home to New York City. earlier in life and chosen my friends more wisely.” See—such a good piece of advice! Hopefully, she’ll put it in her book. She also said she’s most proud of “being strong and allowing myself to accept my faults, and with that, being the person I am today.” Straight into the book.</p><p>She even gave some advice to her younger self:&nbsp;“My mother taught me to always be humble, and that is something I live by still today,” she said. “I would also probably say don’t go too fast. Pay attention to the people you surround yourself with and make sure they have honest intentions. Put yourself first, and just breathe. Be happy and always be grateful for the moment you have in front of you. Be here, now.” I mean, she just wrote the intro to her book. But someone should tell her that Ram Dass wrote “Be Here Now” in 1971, so that title is taken.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHCCj2ttbm5fobavsNKasGakn52ur3nSnqOfZZiaubF5waimpGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
