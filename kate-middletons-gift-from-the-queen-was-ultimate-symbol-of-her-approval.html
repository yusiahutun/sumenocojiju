Kate walked as a <a href=#>royal</a> bride wearing a tiara which was a gift from the late Queen. Netflix’s <a href=#>The Crown</a> actress Meg Bellamy, who plays the bride in the <a href=#>TV</a> series, took a look back at the special moments of Kate talking about the significance of the diamond tiara.</p><p>The actress <a href=# rel=nofollow>offered</a>: “She wore a Cartier kind of halo tiara that she received from the Queen which I think just really symbolizes her acceptance and being welcomed into the royal family officially. It’s just a beautiful and lovely kind of commemoration of her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1298572702-1024x737.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kate-middleton-was-a-rock-for-the-late-queen-during-pandemic>Kate Middleton was a ‘rock’ for the late Queen during pandemic</h2><p>Kate Middleton’s bond with the late Queen comforted the Monarch as she trusted the Princess of Wales as ‘the future of the monarchy,’ a source once revealed. The former Duchess of Cambridge also relied on the Queen to seek advice on her speeches among other things.</p><p>“Kate asks for advice about speeches she’s due to make, whom she can depend on most within the palace, and protocol dos and don’ts. The queen’s more than happy to impart her wisdom — she’s proud to be Catherine’s go-to adviser about royal life,” the insider offered.</p><p>Especially during the pandemic, Katherine was a ‘rock’ to the Queen. “More than anything, knowing she can rely on Kate and [William] to handle matters in her absence is the greatest comfort she could ask for,” a <a href=# rel=nofollow>source</a> told Us Weekly in August 2020.</p><p>The late Queen definitely impacted Kate in the best way possible, as a second insider claimed: “Kate has flourished into a queen in waiting in front of everyone’s eyes. Kate may change some of the outdated royal rules when she becomes queen [consort].”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2WAcLfArZxmpZmZsa2x06ilrGWXnrO1ecWrpqZlpJ2ybr3UnpynZaeWwG7By62gppmkmnq0xcybpqVln5t6qbHRZpipqKKkw6K4jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
