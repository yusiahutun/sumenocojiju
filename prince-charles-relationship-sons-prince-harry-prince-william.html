Speaking on the podcast in May, Harry said: "Certainly, when it comes to parenting,<strong> if I've experienced some form of pain and suffering because of the pain and suffering that perhaps my father or parents suffered</strong>, I'm gonna make sure I break that cycle so that I don't pass it on."</p><p id=esmfPEOqwMQK>And later that month, Harry also said on his Apple TV+ series, : "My father used to say to me when I was younger, he used to say to <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>William</a></strong> and I, 'Well, it was like that for me, so it's gonna be like that for you.' That doesn't make sense. <strong>Just because you suffered, it doesn't mean that your kids have to suffer. </strong>In fact, quite the opposite. If you suffered, do everything you can to make sure that whatever experiences, negative experiences that you had, <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>you can make it right for your kids</a></strong>."</p><p id=eUHTeITY4TI2>Despite all the pain Harry still feels and felt growing up, he is determined to reconcile with his dad.
