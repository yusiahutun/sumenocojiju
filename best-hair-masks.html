Color-treating, heat-styling, using harsh chemical products, and even just daily washing are a few of the biggest damage-causing culprits that leave hair feeling dry and looking dull or frizzy, making it more vulnerable to future breakage.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But it’s not all bad news: There’s a clear and easy way to repair your damaged hair — a hair mask. The best hair masks are solution-oriented, multitasking products that are formulated with a long list of nourishing and strengthening ingredients to provide impressive hydrating prowess and reverse much of the havoc wreaked on your strands, to give you the soft, shiny hair that dreams are made of.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">From strengthening damaged hair strands to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>stimulating hair growth</a>, there’s a hair mask for nearly every kind of concern. We researched the expansive range of hair masks out there and formed a list of the 30 most popular options to test and evaluate for ourselves. We slathered each of the 30 hair masks onto our strands and scalp for two weeks, taking note of the texture and consistency of each one. We also evaluated how the mask made our hair look and feel, in order to determine exactly which hair masks lived up to the hype.&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-olaplex-no-8-bond-intense-moisture-mask></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Olaplex No. 8 Moisture Mask</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Olaplex No. 8 Bond Intense Moisture Mask" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/hcPywlfKMjPjHiz51NldqUQDGrU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Olaplex-No-8-Intense-Bond-Moisture-Mask-20ef83cc42554e39a91cc24d7c2ce3e9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel/Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hair Look & Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> A little product goes a long way with this hair mask, so you'll get great results without having to constantly buy a new bottle.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Those with particularly dry hair may still need to use other hydrating products after this mask.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Olaplex is a giant in the hair mask space — and for very good reason. We tested their No. 8 Bond Intense Moisture Mask for two weeks and it earned our top marks for its ability to transform our dry, brittle strands into softer feeling and healthier looking hair with just two uses.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When we first saw the size of this bottle, we were worried we’d go through the whole thing in just a few uses. However, we were pleasantly surprised to see how little product we actually needed to get the job done — the recommended two pumps was more than enough to coat our hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The mask had a rather thick consistency when it came out, but as soon as it touched our hair, it became creamy and light. It spread easily from the middle of our hair to our ends, and we loved how even the coverage was, even on our kinky curls.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We loved how easy and quick this mask was to use. It not only fit seamlessly into our shower routine, but it also transformed our post-shower hair routine. Before the mask, we had to rely on a leave-in conditioner and mousse to keep our curls bouncy and untangled. But after, we were able to significantly cut down on these other products. Our hair still needed a little post-shower hydration after the mask, but even without it, curls stayed very defined.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Ceramides, hyaluronic acid, bisaminopropyl digycol dimaleate｜<strong>Best for:</strong> Strengthening, hydrating｜<strong>Size:</strong> 3.30 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-luxury-christophe-robin-regenerating-mask-with-prickly-pear-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Luxury</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Christophe Robin Regenerating Mask</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=866 data-sizes=750px alt="Christophe Robin Regenerating Mask" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/vFrRQBISkqDFCWwTNs7pDHRtA6I=/fit-in/1500x866/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Screenshot2024-02-14at3.08.14PM-93eaedbb2de2466fa40c0fdbc4de75de.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel/Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hair Look & Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This hair mask has a great consistency that feels creamy yet lightweight, and it has a soft, lovely scent.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Although this hair mask delivers impressive results after just one use, it won’t totally fix your split ends.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most hair masks require a lengthy time commitment to see results, but Christophe Robin’s Regenerating Mask works its magic without the downtime. We applied the mask twice a week for just five minutes each time, using our scalp massager to run it through our ends, and our hair instantly felt softer.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The creamy mask was a breeze to work into our hair, coating each strand from root to ends, and the subtle scent — which we suspect is a byproduct of the added prickly pear seed oil — smelled amazing. After rinsing it out, our locks felt extra clean and noticeably more moisturized, which really enhanced the overall look and feel of our hair.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While our split-ends didn’t just disappear after one wash, they did feel much less dry and brittle, and we’re confident that with continued use, the mask will bring even more life to our hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Prickly pear seed oil, plant ceramides, inula flower extract｜<strong>Best for:</strong> Hydration, shine｜<strong>Size: </strong>8.33 oz</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2443 data-sizes=750px alt="Christophe Robin Regenerating Mask with Prickly Pear Oil" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BjCR1WtCuRmU5iZby4IXjX1HhtA=/fit-in/1500x2443/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-hair-mask-test-christophe-robin-regenerating-prickly-pear-oil-maria-bouselli-01-82cf4558905542fd8e96f50bf1e4c54d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Maria Bouselli</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2624 data-sizes=750px alt="Christophe Robin Regenerating Mask with Prickly Pear Oil" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ixmAFMb92EPrK4WtpGMmu8Tn2f0=/fit-in/1500x2624/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-hair-mask-test-christophe-robin-regenerating-prickly-pear-oil-maria-bouselli-02-943375914a8b43348e5abeee5195b40f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Maria Bouselli</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-damaged-hair-shu-uemura-ultimate-reset-hair-mask></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Damaged Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Shu Uemura Ultimate Reset Hair Mask</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Shu Uemura Ultimate Reset Hair Mask" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/dZS46lftBBKV1taSHxDMleCvFms=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Shu-Uemura-Ultimate-Reset-Treatment-Mask-bc38b2b0d2ec40a1a94ac580a281203f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Thanks to the Japanese-sourced rice extract in this hair mask, it not only hydrates hair but also protects it from further damage.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> This hair mask requires a very thorough rinse-out to avoid feeling greasy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This rich, creamy mask feels like a big, warm hug for damaged hair. It felt decadent and luxurious as soon as we put it on our fine hair, and left it feeling soft and buttery to the touch as soon as we rinsed it out. We will say that it took a little extra elbow grease to fully get it out — when we didn’t rinse the mask out well, it left our fine hair feeling a bit weighed down (though, that might not be the case for thicker hair).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This mask features the ultra-hydrating and protective ingredient Japanese-sourced rice extract in its formula, so hair not only feels moisturized and healthy after using it, but it will also stay that way, even when facing heat, harsh chemicals or hair dye. We loved how glossy and touchable our hair looked after using this mask and even our hairstylist was impressed by our newly transformed hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Japanese-sourced rice extract｜<strong>Best for:</strong> Damaged hair｜<strong>Size:</strong> 6 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-curly-hair-pattern-treatment-mask></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Curly Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pattern Treatment Mask</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pattern Treatment Mask" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5X2nczMPDd8GmCVjbHjHbZPfvmw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Pattern-Treatment-Mask-0eb772e724b14d63af469ebbcb1bc8e2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel/Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hair Look & Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This hair mask is great for detangling curly or coiled hair.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The watery consistency doesn't feel substantial.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Pattern Beauty, founded by Tracee Ellis Ross, is a line of hair products designed to enhance curly and coily hair types, and our curls soaked up all the goodness from the brand's hair mask in record time to reveal smoother strands and bouncier ringlets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although this mask has a watery gel consistency — a noticeable departure from traditional creamy masks — that’s also what allows it to be hydrating without being oily. It felt soft and lightweight as soon as we scooped the mask into our hands and didn’t feel too heavy when we massaged it through our hair.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When we washed the mask out, our curly hair was immediately untangled, and all we had to do was run our fingers through to loosen any tighter coils. It also added visible hydration and reversed some of the damage done from coloring our hair. But unlike other hair masks we’ve used, Pattern’s didn’t weigh our hair down or strip it of natural oils.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After styling, the results improved even more. Our hair felt springy, light, and nourished, with considerably less frizz and fewer fly-aways. Even the baby hairs that typically stick straight up after we blowdry and straighten our hair stayed in place.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Moringa seed extract, rice protein, hibiscus｜<strong>Best for: </strong>Curly, color-treated hair｜<strong>Size:</strong> 15 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-frizz-fable--mane-holiroots-repairing-hair-mask></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Frizz</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Fable & Mane HoliRoots Hair Mask</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Fable &amp;amp; Mane HoliRoots Repairing Hair Mask" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/JQFJQw_cyyICTFhl3iam6Sxp4c4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Fable-Mane-HoliRoots-Repairing-Hair-Mask-9d898384b2c24e1895dfb12f853571c2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel/Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hair Look & Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Fable & Mane’s hair mask is designed to give deep hydration, so it’s ideal for smoothing flyaways, especially for thick, dry, and curly hair types.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Some users find this mask’s scent to be overpowering.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This cult-favorite hair mask takes hydration to a whole new level. Created with curly and frizzy hair in mind, it harnesses intensely hydrating ingredients, like coconut cream and mango butter, to soothe any signs of dryness or breakage — and boy, did it deliver.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We used the creamy mask on our thick hair once a week for a month and were blown away by the transformation of our straw-like strands into smooth, frizz-free hair. The mask had a great texture and consistency, albeit a very rich one, and it was undeniably hydrating. We especially loved how much it soothed our ends — the part of our hair that’s most prone to frizziness — and that it kept them free of flyaways, even several days after using the mask.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While our ends remained smooth, the rest of our hair felt pretty heavy after a while and left a slick, greasy sensation that we had to remedy with dry shampoo. With that in mind, Fable & Mane’s hair mask should be applied from the mid-shaft to the ends, avoiding the roots completely, and it's best suited for those with especially thick, curly, or dry hair, who need extra moisture.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Coconut cream, mango butter, banana｜<strong>Best for:</strong> Curly, thick, dry hair｜<strong>Size:</strong> 8 oz</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-8 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=919 data-sizes=750px alt="Fable & Mane HoliRoots Repairing Hair Mask" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3eQMPww4Ws3PKy3uWleVmDcLNWI=/fit-in/1500x919/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-hair-mask-test-fable-mane-holiroots-repairing-leslie-kelly-01-6db1ce6d830e4f2695323a92f251b3d9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Leslie Kelly</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=1508 data-sizes=750px alt="Fable & Mane HoliRoots Repairing Hair Mask" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/pL450yiSF3Baxen0K8sktrMDiJo=/fit-in/1500x1508/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-hair-mask-test-fable-mane-holiroots-repairing-leslie-kelly-02-a297fd816566483698602eb3a5ce3ca9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Leslie Kelly</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-fine-hair-sachajuan-hair-repair></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Fine Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sachajuan Hair Repair</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sachajuan Hair Repair" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ErdHDpZZeeLW3nWpVVzX6TACFV4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Sachajuan-Hair-Repair-1a2d97192186480cb941b5b08d58206e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dermstore</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel/Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hair Look & Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This hair mask is at once hydrating and lightweight, so it will give fine or oily hair a boost of vibrance without weighing it down.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Although a little product is all you need to get results, the mask’s pump dispenses only a tiny bit at a time, so you need to do a few pumps to get enough.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Frankly, we were skeptical when we first saw Sachajuan’s Hair Repair. Unlike many other masks we’ve tried, which have a thick, creamy consistency, this was noticeably lighter, thinner and felt more water-based than oil-based. But as soon as we doused our hair with the mask, all our concerns were laid to rest. It not only felt amazing on our fine hair, but it also spread evenly and easily without causing any greasiness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hair masks can be a tricky journey for those of us with fine hair, as creamy hair masks usually make our hair feel heavy or look greasy by the end of the day, but thanks to this one's thinner formulation, it felt light as a feather without any of the usual weighed-down feeling. We immediately noticed a difference when it came to tangles and frizz, which all but disappeared after using the product, even after applying heat and styling. The mask kept our hair hydrated and light throughout the day, and we appreciated that it didn’t require us to wash our hair more frequently than normal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our only complaint was with the mask’s pump, which offered only a small bit of product at a time.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Algae extract, castor oil, dimethicone｜<strong>Best for:</strong> Thin, fine, oily hair｜<strong>Size:</strong> 7.4 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-dry-hair-dae-deep-conditioning-hair-treatment></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Dry Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>dae Deep Conditioning Treatment</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="dae Deep Conditioning Hair Treatment" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/uFyN_GOzEh8M4nEQQBtZgJXQdW4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dae-Deep-Conditioning-Hair-Treatment-29bcc6d5d17c40ed862ab7acea358a78.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel/Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hair Look & Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Loved:</strong> This deep conditioning mask is formulated with clean, good-for-you ingredients that won’t cause any buildup.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The results aren’t exactly long-term, so you have to use this treatment regularly to see continued improvement.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’d consider ourselves somewhat of a hair mask expert, having tried dozens throughout the years — but dae’s Deep Conditioning Hair Treatment is definitely one of the best we've come across.

The mask made our hair more manageable post-shower, especially when it came to tangles. We noticed that there were fewer knots in our hair after using this mask, and the ones that we did have broke apart with minimal resistance.

And while most people tend to avoid the scalp when using a hair mask, Medchill says to go for it, unless your hair is fine, thin or prone to greasiness. “Scalp health is everything right now, so it’s ideal to use a&nbsp;mask&nbsp;on your scalp if you can,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Depending on the mask and your specific goals, you can also do a longer, deeper treatment, over the course of a few hours before your shower or even overnight. You can do this anywhere from once a month to once a week.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is a hair mask the same as a deep conditioner?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hair masks are targeted treatments that offer more hydration and repair than a deep conditioner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Conditioner is generally applied on just the ends to seal the&nbsp;hair&nbsp;and lightly moisturize the ends and reduce frizz and can be used every time you wash,” Ohlmeyer explains.&nbsp;“Hair&nbsp;masks are a higher concentration of moisture or protein and reparative qualities that should be used once a week. They are formulated to be more hydrating, more nourishing, and more restorative than conditioner.”&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop with Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">InStyle contributor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Gabby Shacknai</a> has been covering beauty and health for more than six years, writing for a long list of leading magazines and websites.
