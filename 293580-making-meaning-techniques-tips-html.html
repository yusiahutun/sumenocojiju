Here are the Do’s and Don’ts of making out with your partner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7ee533152aa63418.png><h3><strong>1. Look the part</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Among the first make out tips for beginners is that you need to dress for the part. Wear something sexy for your date and something light so that he can get his hands under them if he wants. Secondly, oral hygiene is of the essence. No one wants to kiss a smelly mouth, yuck! So ensure to brush your teeth well and have a mouth wash for a quick rinse with you if you feel or know that there will be kissing during the date. Thirdly, moisturize your lips so that they are soft, supple and kissable!</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7222f56bbfd3a256.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing badass quotes for men</span></p></a><h3><strong>2. Suck gently, suck hard</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Knowing how to kiss on lips is best done with a bit of unpredictability which involves sucking on the lips in a gentle manner and then taking things a notch higher and sucking a bit hard. You can start with two soft sucks then let go, resume and go in harder. To figure out where to put your lips when you kiss your lover, start off by sucking on their bottom lip and then move up to their top lip slowly and gently before increasing the pace.</p><h3><strong>3. Make eye contact</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a583364f385986f1.jpg><p class=align-left>Learning how to make out with your boyfriend requires pulling away from them from time to time, and peeping into their eyes. This portrays your interest in them and gears them up for more action. Most people refer to the peeks as ‘bedroom eyes’ and it is believed they speak volumes; so be ready for next level action as it will happen for sure.

Pay attention to the right amount of pressure</strong></h3><p class=align-left>One way to mess up a great kissing session is by going overboard with the pressure you use on your lover. Some individuals will exert much force resulting to bumping teeth, coming off as aggressive or pushing their lovers backwards. No one wants this. Learning how to kiss well involves using the correct pressure so that it isn’t too much or too little. Just give it a thought, the same way a tight handshake will make you feel awkward and strange so is using a lot of pressure when kissing.</p><h3><strong>5. Keep biting to a minimum</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Only engage in gentle nipping as opposed to biting as you might end up hurting your partner. Begin with a gentle bite and if you notice that your partner doesn’t like it, then abort the mission and keep on trying other making out tips and techniques.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e307adda0fd9ba6b.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The most rib-cracking love quotes of all time</span></p></a><h3><strong>6. Keep your hands busy</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Among the things to do while making out with your boyfriend includes using your hands as they play a big part during the make-out session. You can use your hands to gently touch his face, neck, interlink your fingers with his, place your arms around their body, play with his hair or hold him by his waist. Alternatively, take smaller breaks from their lips and kiss them on other body parts such as the neck and ears.</p><h3><strong>7. Tongue action is necessary but not too much</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Signs that one is a make out beginner include the act of using too much tongue which comes out a sloppy and no one wants that. After you and your partner start kissing, keep the tongue out and dwell on ways that you can kiss them while your mouth is closed while opening it occasionally. When things get heated, then you start using your tongue but in a sparingly approach. Never put too much of your tongue into their mouth or take a jab with your tongue on your lover. When learning how to kiss someone, a gentle tongue caress is all you need to do.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fdd04fbca4402a1d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ funny African proverbs with meanings (they'll get you thinking)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>If you are still unsure on the way to use your tongue during kissing, try practicing on the back of your hand so that you can see how strong the organ is and how things really feel.

Adapt your techniques</strong></h3><p class=align-left>After all that is said and done, every person has unique kissing skills and therefore you will need to adjust your making out techniques to match your partners. When making out with them, take note of what they seem to react to best. For instance, does she moan when you note her lower lip? Are they moving their tongue very slowly? In case you can’t tell what they like or not, just ask your companion to kiss you how they love to be kissed and then follow their lead.</p><h3><strong>10. Don’t judge yourself too much</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Although we have explored several techniques on how to make out with your mate, remember not to pay much attention to the techniques and instead be in the moment and enjoy it.
