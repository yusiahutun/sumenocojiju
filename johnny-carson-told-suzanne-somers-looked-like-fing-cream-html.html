He ended up putting her on air to read her poetry.</p><p id=par-4_19>Eventually, Cohen asked if Carson ever hit on her, and she said he hadn’t but added, “Except once.”</p><p id=par-5_39>She explained it was during a break when she was a guest and Carson was drumming on his desk with his pen. That’s when she said he looked over at her and declared, “You look like f***ing cream.”</p><p id=par-6_8>According to her, she simply replied, “Huh.”</p><p id=par-7_52>Notably, Somers was <a href=#>discovered on Carson’s Tonight Show</a> in consideration for her role on Three’s Company. Furthermore, she told Cohen in another <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Radio Andy</a> interview that she didn’t think Carson had salacious motives in their relationship, and she was grateful he provided her with a stepping stone to her acting career.</p><h2 id=h-johnny-carson-told-dolly-parton-he-d-pay-a-hefty-price-for-a-peek-under-her-dress>Johnny Carson told Dolly Parton he’d pay a hefty price for a peek under her dress</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/DollyPartonJohnnyCarson.jpg><p id=par-8_40>When <a href=#>Dolly Parton chatted with Carson</a>&nbsp;in 1977, the two made it clear that they had already established a friendly rapport. But the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tonight Show interview</a> seemed to get playfully tense when the public curiosity about her body came up.</p><p id=par-9_15>“I’ve always been pretty well blessed,” Parton shared. “People are always asking if they’re real.”</p><p id=par-10_24>Carson coyly promised he “would never,” but she told him, “Oh, you don’t have to ask. I tell you what. These are mine.”</p><p id=par-11_19>“I have certain guidelines,” Carson carefully replied, “but I would give about a year’s pay to peek under there.”</p><p id=par-12_22>Parton gave the forward line an animated laugh. Notably, she was also a somewhat frequent guest with Carson at The Tonight Show.</p><h2>Joan Rivers claimed she and Johnny Carson had a one-night affair</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/JoanRiversJohnnyCarson.jpg><p id=par-13_52>Like Somers, another star who got a break on The Tonight Show was <a href=#>late comedian, Joan Rivers.</a> And she also claimed that Carson gave her a line. Actually, she said she was a participant in a one-night stand but one might assume some lines were used if this story is true.</p><p id=par-14_52>Though both Carson and Rivers are dead, the story of their Hollywood friendship and falling out remains one of the more intriguing. She was a guest host on The Tonight Show, and seemingly a pretty good friend of Carson’s. However, she eventually took her own late-night show with a competing network.</p><p id=par-15_29>Rivers said she tried to call Carson before anyone else, but it was supposedly once the deal was done. Whatever the details, he never spoke to her again.</p><p id=par-16_38>However, she claimed to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> late in her own life and after Carson had already died that the two had a closer relationship than was ever made public. That’s when she claimed they had a one-night stand.</p><p id=par-17_48>And she was compelled to share the information with the world at that point because rumors of a Carson sex tape emerged, creating gossip that he was well-endowed, anatomically speaking. She seemed to confirm those rumors with her own tale of having spent one night with Carson.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3sLTNp7Bmm5GnwLC6jK2mpZxdqMK7rc2nnGarn6Kys7%2BMpaaoo5WZeq21yp5kn6GenHqkvsSapGegpKK5cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
