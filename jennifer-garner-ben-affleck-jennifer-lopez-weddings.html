An insider told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hollywood Life</a>&nbsp;on August 18, 2022 that she’s still supportive of the wedding and all their celebrations. “<span class=markgv6aaov0j data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Jennifer</span>&nbsp;<span class=markt9l5xjqxe data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Garner</span> is hard at work on a project in Texas and won’t be attending the wedding celebration, but she’s been totally supportive of her kids being there and is really positive in general about the whole thing,” the source said. “There is nothing more important to her than her kids’ happiness so the fact that they feel welcomed and at ease and have bonded with J-Lo and her kids is just the best thing she could ask for.” Ben and Jen were married from 2005 to 2018 and have three kids together: Violet, 16, Seraphina, 13 and Samuel, 10.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>RELATED: Click Here For the Best New Binge-Worthy Shows You Haven’t Seen—But Should</a></strong></p><p>Another source revealed that the 13 Going On 30 star already sent well wishes to the newlywed couples. “Ben will always consider Jennifer family so of course he extended an invitation,” the source revealed. “Plus, Jennifer and Jen have become closer so J.Lo was fully supportive of inviting the mother of his kids. Jennifer knows they adore J-Lo and she’s fully on board with them getting close with their new stepmom. Jennifer has wished them all the best and knows it will be a beautiful event.”</p><p>Ben did <a href=# rel=noopener>warn his ex-wife</a> of his first spontaneous Las Vegas wedding with J-Lo. “Ben did tell Jen about the wedding, but I’m told that it was only Friday at the earliest,” a source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six.</a> “It was very, very minimally planned in advance and was largely spur-of-the-moment. Violet stayed home because she’s extremely loyal to her mom.” Ben and Jen Garner were together from 2005 to 2018.

She described the wonderful details of the wedding: about how they arrived and how it was all so sudden for her. &nbsp;“Last night we flew to Vegas, stood in line for a license with four other couples, all making the same journey to the wedding capital of the world,” she wrote on July 17, 2022. “Behind us two men held hands and held each other. In front of us, a young couple who made the three hour drive from Victorville on their daughter’s second birthday—all of us wanting the same thing— for the world to recognize us as partners and to declare our love to the world through the ancient and nearly universal symbol of marriage.” She signed the newsletter, “With love, Mrs. Jennifer Lynn Affleck.”</p><p>Bennifer 2.0 had their<a href=# rel=noopener> extravagant second wedding</a> on the weekend of August 19, 2022, where they celebrated their marriage for three days.
