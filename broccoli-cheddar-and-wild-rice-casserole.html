That said, among people I’ve interrogated, reviews are mixed. One friend gushed that it was the only way he’d eat broccoli growing up, another asked me to please bring it back in style, but the girl at the coffee shop this morning said it “smelled disgusting and was often made with Cheez-Whiz,” (sigh, another magical food on the Denied list). And it would be journalistically irresponsible for me not to mention that the dish was called out by name by <a href=#>Cook’s Illustrated founder Chris Kimball in a New York Times op-ed</a> in the days after my beloved Gourmet magazine folded as an example of the web failing to live up to its promise. “Google ‘broccoli casserole’ and make the first recipe you find,” he challenged. “I guarantee it will be disappointing.”</p><p><a title="ready for assembly" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7369/13085841204_2c05cf66fc_z.jpg alt="ready for assembly" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><a title="steamy broccoli, draining" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3650/13085651513_5f504abae2_z.jpg alt="steamy broccoli, draining" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="bringing on the cheese sauce" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7447/13085528905_201904562a_z.jpg alt="bringing on the cheese sauce" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="ready to bake and broil" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3582/13085529795_1695cf96dc_z.jpg alt="ready to bake and broil" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Feh, I say, let people cook however they want. And this here is my way (published on an internet website no less!) which is to say, look, I totally failed. Lacking warm memories that would anchor my plans to the original iteration of the dish, I instead made this, a wild rice casserole with broccoli and, yes, cheddar cheese sauce, broiled until crisp on top. I have zero regrets; we were too busy eating it to consider how heretical it might be. Well, most of us. <a href=#>Certain members</a> of our family will only eat broccoli and rice if they arrive separately on his plate, thank you very much, and I cannot wait until he has a food blog one day to air these injustices, too.</p><p><a title="broccoli, cheddar and wild rice casserole" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3291/13085535025_2180542215_z.jpg alt="broccoli, cheddar and wild rice casserole" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="broccoli, cheddar and wild rice casserole" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm3.staticflickr.com/2780/13085661593_86d6a25c1b_z.jpg alt="broccoli, cheddar and wild rice casserole" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>Talk to me:</strong> What foods did you envy at friends houses that you were denied at your own?

Once melted, add onion and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add rice to onion and cook for 1 minute, then add 1 1/3 cups water and a few pinches of salt. Bring mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat to lowest temperature and cook with the lid on for about 50 minutes (or whatever amount of time is suggested on your package of rice). If you’d like a rice cooker to do this for you, transfer onions, water and rice to the machine and set the machine.</p><p>Heat oven to 400 degrees.</p><p>Peel broccoli stems and dice them into large chunks. Cut florets into 1-inch pieces. Cook in boiling, well-salted water for 2 to 3 minutes, then drain.</p><p>You can use this same pan to make the cheese sauce. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in pan over medium heat. Once melted, add the mustard powder (if using), a pinch of cayenne and garlic and let sizzle for 1 minute. Add flour and whisk until combined, cooking the butter-flour mixture for 1 to 2 minutes. Slowly drizzle in milk, whisking constantly, then broth. Bring to a simmer and cook mixture at a simmer, stirring the whole time, until sauce is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in smooth Dijon mustard if you didn’t use mustard powder.</p><p>Remove pan from heat and stir in 1/3 of grated cheese until melted. Season generously with salt and pepper.</p><p>Combine cooked wild rice blend and broccoli in a 2-quart baking dish or a 9-inch oven-safe skillet. Pour cheese sauce over and gently nudge to ensure all pieces get some sauce. Sprinkle remaining cheese over top. Bake casserole for 10 to 15 minutes, until the sauce is bubbly, then run mixture under the broiler until cheese is toasty on top.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-11573 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-11573 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
