He was out on the runway of the stage and before I walked up on stage they said something to us about pyrotechnics on stage, so they were not allowing so many people out there," Owen explained. "When the shots started being fired, at first I thought it was pyrotechnics. You could see it ricocheting off the stage and on the sage. That's when I noticed people literally being shot. It was pretty chaotic. It's kind of a bad movie."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:13ae551e-c19e-5703-8aef-2dbe68c17376 data-container-ref=toofab:article:42c00745-6292-5f96-a68a-0d72bc5936f2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a2/5by4/2017/10/02/a26ffdf4d9de555fb7cb0beb2ed24bcd_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Las Vegas Shooting: How Jason Aldean and Other Country Stars at Route 91 Harvest Festival Are Reacting</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"It stopped for about 30 seconds and almost like a reload. Literally at that point, people were running in all directions and chaos is happening," he said. "I ran and somehow found a bus to hop on in another parking lot. I was pretty scared, along with a lot of other people."</p><p>Owen tweeted during the chaos, sending a message to his 4-year-old daughter Pearl on Twitter:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Gun shots!!! Vegas.

By the time I got to the street, there was definitely people in the street covered in blood. People screaming, not knowing what to do," Owen continued. "Some of us can't get a hold of other people. We put on concerts to take people away form the day to day life and bring them to a happy place and this isn't by any means what's supposed to happen at these things. I think us as a community aren't gonna let this bring us down either. we're going to continue to do what we do and bring people up, because this isn't what America's supposed to be like. We've got to fix this."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a74b47ba-6258-5254-9ca1-6651c6ea4e78 data-container-ref=toofab:article:42c00745-6292-5f96-a68a-0d72bc5936f2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0d/5by4/2017/10/02/0d3fe4c71f5558cc965e743a02aa4cb6_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Las Vegas Attack Sends Chills Down Hollywood's Spine: Stars React to Deadliest Shooting in U.S. History</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Owen went on to say the shooter, Stephen Paddock, had "a perfect angle."</p><p>"You have a sea full of people out there and a guy that sounded like a fully automatic rifle. There was no chance for a lot of people to get out of the way, everyone was just scrambling," he said. "No matter where you went here, you weren't out of the way."</p><p>Owen then praised local law enforcement for "putting their lives on the line to keep us safe during a moment like this."</p><p>"I think the most unfortunate thing is, you're looking into the crowd tonight you see fathers with their kids on their shoulders and this is a country concert people came to from all over and they just came to enjoy themselves," he added. "Everyone knows what's out there and the possibilities but the thing about our beautiful country, thanks to the men and women fighting for our freedom, we get to everyday walk out there and feel that we're ok and safe in this country."</p><p>"You tend to forget about this sort of thing," he added, before trailing off.
