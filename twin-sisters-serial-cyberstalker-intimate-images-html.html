Madison and Christine Conradis endured a decade of harassment after finding their intimate images posted on 4chan - followed by a series of intimidating messages sent to them by anonymous social media accounts.
Despite being turned down by police, the sisters continued their fight - which ended last December."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The pictures were also being sent to her father, her friends, and her boss.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Despite the harassment, Madison was told by police in Madison, Florida, that what she was experiencing wasn't criminal and there was nothing to be done.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But as the torment continued and Madison received Facebook messages from anonymous accounts demanding new photos, her sister Christine who had just passed the bar decided to step in where law enforcement had failed to help.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 2016, Madison also started dating her new boyfriend&nbsp;Jeffrey Geiger. During a trip to Florida Keys, she posted a sunset on her Snapchat story - that was viewed by 39 people.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The next morning, she got a message from one of the anonymous harassment accounts saying: 'You guys having a great time in the keys I see.' Madison scoured the 39 names who saw the photo and honed in on one -&nbsp;Christopher Buonocore.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A year later, when Madison's relationship with&nbsp;Geiger was breaking down, she realized new images of her were being posted on 4chan. They were nude images she had sent her boyfriend.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Boudoir images of Christine, that she had sent to her husband, were also being posted.&nbsp;Geiger had had access to them via Dropbox.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was at this point that the twins confronted Geiger - who allegedly confessed to getting in touch with the anonymous harassing accounts and sent them the new nude images of his girlfriend and her sister.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Geiger left a handwritten note for Christine, a copy of which she included in the court records: 'I am an idiot and don't deserve your sister.

He asked fellow users for advice on how to trick her into sending him nudes.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said he wanted to have sex with her, according to the plea agreement. In one post, he wrote, 'I have a strong desire to watch [her] get raped,' and he offered to pay someone to do it, the plea agreement seen by WaPo said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The third victim, Buonocore's childhood friend, said that he had somehow got a photo of her bare chested when she was 15, and he spread it online, documents say.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The fourth woman was Buonocore's ex-fiancée. After they split up, he posted intimate photos of her online - and she only found out when she was contacted by the twins.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Still being turned down by law enforcement,&nbsp;Christine used her new attorney knowledge and prepared a 59-page document explaining the entire case.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It included all the evidence they found for all six women, and included ways to get around the tight legal restrictions that police departments were consistently turning them down for.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Using the docket, all the women demanded a criminal investigation from their respective investigators.</p><img id=i-bae5eb62f0c14ada src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/08/28/07/74785715-12452073-image-a-39_1693202709817.jpg height=845 width=634 alt="At his trial in November 2021 in Tampa, US District Judge Thomas Barber sentenced Buonocore to 15 years in federal prison" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>At his trial in November 2021 in Tampa, US District Judge Thomas Barber sentenced Buonocore to 15 years in federal prison</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In Manatee County, Florida, the case was finally&nbsp;passed up to federal investigators, and in July 2019, the FBI took over on behalf because the evidence showed that this was a case of interstate cyberstalking.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Months later, thanks to their previous civil case, Madison and Christine also got a final, crucial piece of information.
