They decided to elope for just $179, including airfare.</p><p>“We just had a very normal, very regular wedding,” Kelly once said during an episode of Live in August 2022. “It really is such an efficient way to get married. And it was fun. We were like, ‘Now, this is gambling! Woohoo!'”</p><p>As for the timing of their nuptials, the pair conveniently had two days off in a row back then.

The costars-turned-lovers are now parents to kids Michael, <a href=#>Lola</a> and Joaquin. Still, their wedding day is one of their fondest memories.</p><p>“It was really romantic, though. It was very sweet,” the Emmy winner shared. “We cherish those memories, still to this day. It’s been 28 years and we still can remember every minute of that wedding. And I mean, it was really minutes. It was like two minutes!”</p><p>In addition to visiting the wedding chapel while they are in Vegas this time around, the pair will be interviewing a slew of celebrity guests, including<strong> Sheryl Lee Ralph</strong>, <strong>Howie Mandel</strong>, <strong>Jim Gaffigan</strong> and <strong>Lionel Richie</strong> on Live.</p><p>“During their star-studded stay, Kelly and Mark will be joined each morning by celebrities, musicians and more in front of thousands of fans,” a press release for the special Live broadcasts said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46knKWkqWK%2FqrzAZqSaqptisLC60q6cpaejYr%2BmwNSrpaKml2LBsHnCoZipnZxiwamx2GakmqqinrKlecinZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
