In fact, he’s more fond of the piano.</p><p>Being a man of reason, <a href=#>Machine Gun Kelly</a>, then suggests they should duet an air guitar and piano. However, Brundle says he “can’t do it,” and encourages Kelly to go solo.</p><p>Martin then signals to end the interview, by saying he “has to get on” to which the 33-year-old then puts his thumbs down towards the camera and walks off.</p><p>Fans on the social media platform have been calling the star out, and the interview “awkward, and cringe,” however, the star has had his say.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-machine-gun-kelly-responds-to-awkward-interview>Machine Gun Kelly responds to ‘awkward’ interview</h2><p>As the video circulates around X, the star has replied to many comments, including asking a fan who posted a clip of the awkward interview why he posted “this pointless video.”</p><p>Another fan called his vibe, “the worst.” Again, the star wasn’t taking this and took to the platform to explain himself.</p><p>“My vibe is ‘the worst’ how? because someone put a microphone in my face essentially forcing me to do a random interview when I was just trying to enjoy an event?” he tweeted, before explaining how he ‘couldn’t hear’ the interviewer.</p><p>“Because car engines were so loud I couldn’t hear him? please tell me more about why I’m the worst,” he concluded.</p><p>Seemingly addressing the backlash from the clip, he then tweeted: “My anxiety has won. I hate being in public,” which led to a rally of support from fans.</p><p>Martin, on the other hand, seemed to have a more lighthearted response to the encounter, as he quote tweeted a picture of Meghan Thee Stallion, MGK, and his partner, <a href=#>Megan Fox</a>.</p><p>In the caption, the Sky Sports presenter penned: “Finally, my claim to fame, I’ve met two of these three people. I do appreciate them taking some time out on the grid for our great sport … I hope they didn’t find me too weird.”</p><p>In a memorable interview two years ago, Brundle was ‘ushered away’ from Megan Thee Stallion by her bodyguards who exclaimed “you can’t do that”.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2WDcLnAnJ%2BippVitLa6jKScpaSpYsC1u9GmoKefXaSzp3nIp2StoJViuqqww6WcZqeWYq6vecinq56qpp6yuHnIrGSaZZKWsW7CyJucaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
