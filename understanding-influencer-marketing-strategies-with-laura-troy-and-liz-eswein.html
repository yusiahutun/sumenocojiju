When we’re thinking about campaigns or business objectives, we try to line it up with which influencer would make the most sense.</p><h3><strong>What is the main criteria when a brand like yours decides to choose influencers to bring along the path?</strong></h3><p><strong>Laura Troy:</strong> There are a lot of things that we look at. We would look at the engagement rate of the influencer, as well as the follower count but these are not necessarily the number one things that we look at. From my personal point of view and the brands that I worked with, we really look at the content.</p><h3><strong>Do you prefer being totally creative when working with a brand or do you like brands giving you guidelines to follow?</strong></h3><p><strong>Liz Eswein:</strong> I think it’s all about compromise. As the creator we understand what the final objective from the brand is, then we tailor that accordingly from our perspective. Because we know what works best for our audience and they know what works best for themselves. So finding that middle ground is very important.</p><h3><strong>Do you think brands exactly know about influencer marketing now and do you think brands should consider the influencer as a person and as a team member?</strong></h3><p><strong>Liz Eswein:</strong> The team is exceptionally important on the brand side and also on the creator side. If the creator needs to produce a larger scale production for the client, then they have to scale accordingly. Your team is vetted and they know this space inside and out. I think this is really important.</p><p><strong>There’s lots more on our YouTube channel!
