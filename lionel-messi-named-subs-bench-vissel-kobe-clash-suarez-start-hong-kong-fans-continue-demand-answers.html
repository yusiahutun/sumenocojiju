The Hong Kong government has already demanded answers from the organisers, Tatler Asia, who – sources told the Post – had paid Inter Miami “almost US$7 million” to have the club visit the city."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sports sector lawmaker Kenneth Fok Kai-kong said he “could not let the matter just slide” and that it had harmed Hong Kong’s image.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I don’t want to comment too much on [Inter Miami’s] performance and arrangements in Japan, but there is no doubt this is rubbing salt into the wound of fans in Hong Kong,” Fok said in a Facebook post.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is saddening to see him playing now and looking back to the disappointment of the 40,000 fans at the stadium while Messi scowled and turned down photo ops.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even before Messi stepped onto the field, angry reactions bubbled over on social media in Hong Kong when he was named among the substitutes, with an online forum user saying Inter Miami were clearly “disregarding Hong Kong fans”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While several others adopted a lighter tone, and said it showed the city was, “a good place [for Messi] to recover from injuries”, the discontent was not limited to Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And there could be repercussions for Argentina’s trip to mainland China next month, when they are expected to play friendlies against the Ivory Coast and Nigeria, in Hangzhou and Beijing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chinese netizens on Xiaohongshu, the country’s answer to Instagram, and Weibo, the mainland’s version of X, called for the games to be cancelled.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It was a medical miracle that he recovered instantly as he arrived in Japan,” a Xiaohongshu user said. “It’s hard to imagine that in 2024 there are still people so blatantly discriminating against the Chinese while making money here.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Not everyone took offence, and a Weibo user said suggesting a PR misstep was an example of them “hating China while preferring Japan … was stupid, meaningless and ill-intended”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Messi and his club did their best to apologise, although a statement on a Weibo account attributed to the diminutive forward brought its own chorus of disapproval.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage

e1346ty31">Sent little more than an hour before kick-off in Tokyo, it was posted by someone in Sichuan, a province on the Chinese mainland, and largely reiterated remarks he had made in a press conference on Tuesday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Friends who know me will know that I want to give my best in every game, especially when I come from a long way with my teammates,” the post said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s hoped that we can come back one day, and give our best to the match for the fans in Hong Kong.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In an email to the Post, Inter Miami apologised and said they had “tried everything possible” to get him to play, adding they hoped fans in Hong Kong would welcome them back one day.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Much like in Hong Kong, Messi spent the first half in Tokyo on the bench, but this time he wore football boots and looked raring to go.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He replaced David Ruiz in the 60th minute to roars of approval from the crowd, but the Japanese fans had already seen more action from the 36-year-old before the game started than their Hong Kong counterparts did over two days, with Messi running around the pitch as his team warmed up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And Messi came closest to scoring for Miami in normal time, forcing Kobe goalkeeper Shota Arai into a smart save and then making defender Ryo Hatsuse clear the rebound off the line. Goalless after 90 minutes, Arai starred in the penalty shoot-out as his side won 4-3.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The forward’s absence in Hong Kong caused a row that has rumbled on ever since, and has prompted demands for refunds. Some 825 complaints, totalling HK$5.59 million (US$715,000), have been made to the city’s Consumer Council.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With fans travelling from across the region to attend the game, the council said the highest amount involved in a single case was HK$82,960, while the average amount from each complaint was HK$6,776.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lau Siu-kai, a consultant from the semi-official Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies think tank, said the difference in Messi’s behaviour had sparked conversations over whether he had been influenced by political considerations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lau questioned whether the footballer had been keen not to upset the United States, so had avoided certain officials, such as Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu, because of the sanctions the country had imposed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Hongkongers are feeling humiliated,” he said. “Some individuals may be inclined to believe the possible involvement of foreign forces, because surely it’s not possible for a football team aiming to make a name to overlook the substantial market in China.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mn6efqa%2BiuMtomKusmZi5pnuSa2xqamZrfK21zqecpWWdmsC0tYynmKadlGLAtq7SZpmeppOdere10qycpWWbpK%2BmecKlmKygXajCor7Es2SsrJGnwW60zqeeZqOfo7RussCnqmabn6PBqrrUnmSdnZ2Wu6V5wKeqsJ2iqA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
