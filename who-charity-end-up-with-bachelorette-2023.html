Is this for real? “No way! Oh my god, I’m gonna cry.” Charity asked host <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jesse Palmer</a> when he offered her the opportunity to be the Season 20 Bachelorette. Palmer responded, “Is that a yes? Will you do it?” to which Charity replied, “Absolutely! 100 percent!” She continued, “I’ve waited forever to find the love of my life. It blows my mind that I could meet my person and be engaged and literally have my happily ever after.”</p><p>In an interview on <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Jennifer Hudson Show</a> in May 2023, Charity opened up about what it was like to be one of Bachelor Nation’s few Black Bachelorettes after Season 13’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rachel Lindsay</a>, Season 16’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Tayshia Adams</a>, and Season 18’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michelle Young</a>. “It’s huge. This puts me in the position of being the fourth woman of color to hold this role and the second monoracial African American woman to have the opportunity to find love. I notice and acknowledge that this is so much bigger than myself. It is my journey to love, but it’s bigger than me,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>She continued, “I am just honored to be able to hold that representation for other people at home that look like me, women of color. Like the little girls that can look to me and acknowledge that this is something that’s possible for them too.”</p><p>She also told host Jennifer Hudson about what she was looking for in a husband. “There are a few traits I definitely know that I need after going through past relationships,” she said. “I need someone who is confident and is sure of what they want, so we’re not playing games. I want someone&nbsp; who is funny. A sense of humor is really important. And I want someone who is authentic. I want someone who is themselves and they don’t feel a need to put on a façade. I want the true, real you. Those are the top three things, I think!”</p><p>Charity also told <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Parade</a> in June 2023 about how her breakup with Zach affected her approach on The Bachelorette Season 20. “I learned authenticity,” she said. “Me staying true to myself got me to a certain point and carried me pretty far and so, I really just wanted that to continue to shine through as the lead when meeting all these guys and giving them the space to be expressive of their emotions and meeting them with compassion because that’s exactly what Zach and his approach was with us [bachelorettes]. I was very aware of that and obviously, knowing what it’s like being a contestant, I wanted the same.”</p><p>But back to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>who Charity ends up with as her Bachelorette 2023 winner</a>.

Charity’s Bachelorette 2023 winner is Dotun Olubeko, a 30-year-old integrative medicine specialist from Fresno, California.</p><p>Reality Steve confirmed Charity and Dotun ended up together and are engaged in July 2023. Her fourth place finalist was Aaron Bryant, a 29-year-old software salesman from Katy. Her third place finalist was Xavier Bonner, a 27-year-old biomedical scientist from Euclid, Ohio. Her runner-up was Joey Graziadei, a 27-year-old professional tennis player from Lawai, Hawaii. Charity gave her final rose to Dotun at the Final Rose Ceremony in The Bachelorette Season 20. Dotun also proposed to Charity and they got engaged. Reality Steve confirmed that Charity and Dotun are still together.</p><p>Charity hinted that Dotun was her Bachelorette 2023 winner in July 2023 when posted an Instagram Story of two drinks and a cantle on top of a table in a dimly lit room, which fans deduced was at the restaurant Dutch Fred’s in New York City, New York, where Charity was doing press for The Bachelorette Season 20. A day later, Dotun also posted an Instagram Story of appetizers at Dutch Fred’s and tagged the restaurant before quickly deleting it, which seemed to hint that he and Charity were together. <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Reality Steve</a> tweeted a screenshot of Dotun’s post.</p><p>Before Reality Steve’s confirmation, a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Reddit</a> thread by user @chailatte647 in June 2023 listed clues for both Dotun and Joey as Charity’s Bachelorette winner. The clues for Dotun included Charity’s brother, Nehemiah Lawson, following him on Instagram; Charity following the Instagram account for Mount Hood Railroad where she and Dotun had their first one-on-one; and Charity following the musician Tems, who Dotun was already following. The clues for Joey included Joey’s mother following Nehemiah on Instagram and liking posts that feature Charity; Nehemiah following Joey; and Charity posting and then deleting an Instagram Story of her and Joey on a Barbie-themed Group Date on The Bachelorette Season 20</p><p>For Charity’s engagement, it’s almost certain the ring was designed by Neil Lane, a celebrity jeweler, who has created engagement rings for The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise since 2008. In a 2016 interview with<a href=# rel=nofollow> Entertainment Weekly</a>, former host Chris Harrison revealed that Bachelor Nation couples have to stay together for a certain amount of time, otherwise they have to return the free engagement ring to Neil Lane. “There’s some rule, after a certain number of years, you get to keep it anyway,” he said. “But after months… it goes back.”</p><p>Lane told<a href=#> StyleCaster</a> in 2016 that he doesn’t know where the rings go, but that he designs them with the hope that the couple to stays together. “I make rings hoping that people stay together forever, but after they get the ring, I don’t have a say in it, and what happens after that, I don’t know,” he said. “Where the ring goes, I have to say, I don’t really know. I just say it goes to ring heaven.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dotun-The-Bachelorette-2023.jpg><p>So who is the Bachelorette 2023 winner, Dotun Olubeko?

Just to be free and in public, to live lives normally. This is everything,” Charity said. “She continued, You made me feel alive. You made me believe in love again. You made me feel so valued and so seen. I see you as my husband. I see you as my future. I see it so clear and I don’t have any doubts. I love you so much.”</p><p>Dotun added, “She’s everything to me.” He also told host Jesse Palmer that he’s “never been so sure” of anything in his life than he was in his relationship with Charity.

Joey Graziadei, a 28-year-old professional tennis player from Koloa, Hawaii, and the runner-up on The Bachelorette Season 20 with Charity Lawson, was announced as the Season 28 Bachelor at The Bachelorette Season 20 “After the Final Rose” special in August 2023. “It’s sinking in very slowly but I’m trying my best just to stay present, enjoy it, but this is crazy. I mean, I’ll be the first person to say this is wild. I never expected this at all, didn’t know this is what my life is turning at this moment. So yeah, crazy stuff, but I’m excited,” Joey said.</p><p>Joey, who called the experience “surreal,” told host Jesse Palmer that he felt ready to look for love again after Charity sent him home at the Final Rose Ceremony over her winner, Dotun Olubeko. “I’m more ready than I was in that moment,” Joey said. “For me, it was just, you have to take some time to get a little bit more closure. Watching Dotun and Charity’s connection was enough for me.”</p><p>Joey, who claimed that the breakup “opened up a part of me that wanted something so bad,” also told Palmer what he was looking for in a future partner. “Someone that’s just themselves that I can truthfully be a partner with. I want someone that challenges me. I want someone that I can challenge. I just want someone to do life with. I just want someone that’s going to be my person,” he said.</p><p>During The Bachelorette Season 20 “After the Final Rose” special, Joey also met his first contestant, Leia, who was in the audience for the live taping. “I think we have a lot in common, so I’m excited to kind of explore that,” Leia told Joey during the episode. In an <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a> video after the “After the Final Rose” special, Joey confirmed that was the Bachelor for the right reasons. “I’m definitely the hopeless romantic,” he said. “I want to be married. I want to have a love that lasts a lifetime. So I’m really ready to go on this journey.”</p><p>In an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> in August 2023, Charity commended Joey for a conversation they had about interracial relationships during her Bachelorette season. “It’s huge to have had the opportunity to have that conversation, and then for it to be aired on national television — we don’t see it a lot, especially in this franchise. It was something that I was a little nervous about because I just did not know how it was going to go,” she said. “But my whole plan of being a Black woman in this lead role is having these important conversations. Also, there were conversations that I had with several other men that did not make air, and that’s OK. But it was one of my priorities to have conversations about something that’s extremely important to me and that would essentially become a very important part of their lives, too, if they ended up with me.”</p><p>In a blog post in July 2023, Reality Steve named Joey as The Bachelorette Season 20 contestant most likely to become the next Bachelor for Season 28. “I know Joey fans won’t be happy, but it is what it is,” Reality Steve wrote about Joey not receiving Charity’s Final Rose. “I’m sure he’s got a great shot for Bachelor, so I guess just hope for that. He seems to have the biggest following of Charity’s men and will be the sentimental favorite once Charity breaks up with him at final rose ceremony. So you’d think he’s got a good shot at it, but who knows.”</p><p>Read Joey’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Bachelorette 2023 biography</a> and fun facts ahead:</p><p>“’Love’ may mean nothing in tennis, but to Joey, it’s everything!

The season 20 Bachelorette is Charity Lawson, a contestant from The Bachelor season 27 with Zach Shallcross, who came in fourth place after she was eliminated by Zach after their Hometown Date. Charity is the fourth Black Bachelorette in Bachelor Nation history after Rachel Lindsay (season 13); Tayshia Adams (season 16) and Michelle Young (season 18).&nbsp;</p><p>Charity was announced as the next Bachelorette for 2023 at The Bachelor season 27 “Women Tell All” special on March 15, 2023. “Stop! Is this for real? “No way! Oh my god, I’m gonna cry.” Charity asked host Jesse Palmer when he offered her the opportunity to be the season 20 Bachelorette. Palmer responded, “Is that a yes? Will you do it?” to which Charity replied, “Absolutely! 100 percent!” She continued, “I’ve waited forever to find the love of my life. It blows my mind that I could meet my person and be engaged and literally have my happily ever after.”</p><p>Before Charity was announced as the next Bachelorette for 2023, Zach confirmed his support for Charity as the new lead in an interview with<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Us Weekly</a> in March 2023. “She knows what she wants. She is so confident, she’s so sweet and, you know, she has a great heart,” Zach said. “She’s someone from the very beginning that—I don’t know what exactly it was—but [she] was just trustworthy. She was someone that I asked to, like, get her take on things and while there was some drama in the house early, she was always someone that I believed in [and] I trusted it too. She’s a very trustworthy person and I think she would absolutely kill it as Bachelorette.”</p><p>Palmer also supported Charity as the next Bachelorette. “I think she’d be awesome,” he said, adding that he “totally gets” why so many fans wanted Charity to be the new lead. He continued, “It’s hard because I feel like in past seasons we’ve had an obvious choice, like, two, maybe three [choices]. I feel like this season, there’s five or six that could be tremendous. So I’d love to know who it is and whoever it is, I’m sure it’s going to be an amazing season.”</p><p>Aly Jacobs, who came in eighth place The Bachelor season 27, also voted Charity as the next Bachelorette. “I would definitely say Charity. That’s my girl. I think everyone got to see a little taste of how protective some of us are over Charity when we were in Estonia,” Aly told Us Weekly, referring to when Kat Izzo snuck time with Zach before charity’s one-on-one date. “She’s a gem. She’s so cool, calm and collected. She’s very level-headed and I think, she would have just the best love story, something that I would want to tune into. So, definitely Charity.”</p><p>Brooklyn Willie, who came in sixth place on The Bachelor season 27, also voiced her support for Charity as the next Bachelorette. “If it can’t be me, then I want it to be Charity,” she said. “Charity has been my best friend through the whole thing. I think she is incredible. She’s very intelligent, she’s beautiful. She knows what she wants. This previous season, she’s just had so many moments taken from her. I want to see her get her moment to the full capacity, the full extent, and just absorb every last minute.”</p><p>Cat Wong, who was eliminated in week two on The Bachelor season 27, told Us Weekly, “I would a hundred percent nominate Charity. I think Charity would just be the best thing for this franchise that they need. She’s so in tune with her emotions and she carries her so well in group settings and individually, but also was, like, fun and light-hearted and just is the whole package. And I think that that’s something very refreshing to see — that a beautiful woman can also have all these amazing intellectual qualities too.”</p><p>Kylee Russell, who was eliminated in week five on The Bachelor season 27, also confirmed she was Team Charity as the next Bachelorette. “I am Team Charity. And she was my girl from night one,” Kylee told Us Weekly. “I think she’s so deserving. She deserves everything and more this world has to offer. … She’s a little feisty. She is not afraid to go after what she wants. So she has this calm, sweet demeanor and don’t get me wrong, she’s not a mean girl or anything, but she will stand up for what she believes in.”</p><p>So who is the Bachelorette for 2023, Charity Lawson?

The Bachelorette Season 20 host is Jesse Palmer, who was the season 5 Bachelor in 2004 and was the youngest Bachelor in Bachelor Nation history at 24 years old. Jesse hosted his first Bachelor franchise show in 2022 with The Bachelor season 26 with Clayton Echard. During The Bachelor season 5 finale, Jesse gave his Final Rose to Jessica Bowlin, but didn’t propose to her. Jesse and Jessica continued to date, but ended their relationship a few weeks after the finale of their Bachelor season aired. In June 2020, Jesse and his girlfriend, Emely Fardo, married in an intimate wedding in New York City. Jesse told<a href=# rel=nofollow> Us Weekly</a> in November 2021 that he and Emely planned to marry in Provence, France, before the current health crisis cancelled their wedding date. “We had originally planned a wedding in Provence, France, for summer 2020, which was postponed until summer of 2021 due to the pandemic, but we didn’t want to wait any longer,” he said at the time. “So, we had a small, private and intimate ceremony with close friends who lived in New York City.”</p><p>Jesse graduated from the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played football for the Florida Gators, in 2001 with a bachelor’s of arts degree in political science and a bachelor’s of science degree in marketing.

While my two-decade journey is wrapping up, the friendships I’ve made will last a lifetime.”</p><p><a href=#>Deadline</a> reported at the time that Chris received a mid-range, eight-figure settlement as part of exit plan with ABC, the network that airs the Bachelor franchise, and Warner Bros. Television, the company that produces the Bachelor shows. The magazine also reported that Harrison’s settlement included a nondisclosure agreement. Chris’ decision to retire as Bachelor Nation’s host came after he was slammed for his response to season 25 Bachelor contestant<a href=#> Rachael Kirkconnell’s racism</a> scandal in February 2021.<a href=#> Rachael</a>, the<a href=#> winner of Matt James’ season</a>, faced backlash at the time when photos resurfaced of her at an Old South Antebellum-themed party at Georgia College in 2018. Before the pictures went viral, Rachael was already under controversy after her former high school classmate accused her on TikTok of bullying her and other students for dating Black men. Other TikTok users then exposed Rachael for liking social media photos of her friends in culturally insensitive costumes and with Confederate flags.</p><p><a href=#>Chris came under controversy</a> after he was interviewed about the scandal by season 13 Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay on Extra. During the interview, Chris asked fans to give Rachael “grace” and explained that he didn’t find the Antebellum party photos offensive because they just looked like pictures a college student takes at a party. Harrison also questioned whether the photos would be considered racially insensitive in 2018 when they were taken. After the interview, many fans slammed Harrison and accused him of excusing Rachael’s behavior.</p><p>ABC confirmed in March 2021 that Chris wouldn’t host season 17 of The Bachelorette and would be replaced by Tayshia and Kaitlyn. “Chris Harrison will not be hosting the next season of The Bachelorette,” ABC said in a statement at the time. “We support Chris in the work that he is committed to doing. In his absence, former Bachelorettes Tayshia Adams and Kaitlyn Bristowe will support the new Bachelorette through next season. As we continue the dialogue around achieving greater equity and inclusion within The Bachelor franchise, we are dedicated to improving the BIPOC representation of our crew, including among the executive producer ranks. These are important steps in effecting fundamental change so that our franchise is a celebration of love that is reflective of our world.” He officially retired as the Bachelor Nation’s host in June 2021.</p><p>The Bachelorette is available to stream on <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Hulu</a>.
