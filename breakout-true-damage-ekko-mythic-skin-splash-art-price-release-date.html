Since 2014, Riot has been making music videos based on League of Legends. At that time, Riot released their first band, Pentakill, and the first Worlds music video, Warriors by Imagine Dragons.
Afterwards, they made two more music bands. One is K/DA, and the other one is True Damage. K/DA was initially formed with Ahri, Akali, Evelynn, and Kai’Sa."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

At that time, Riot released their first band, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pentakill</a>, and the first Worlds music video, Warriors by Imagine Dragons.</p><p>Afterwards, they made two more music bands. One is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">K/DA</a>, and the other one is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">True Damage</a>. K/DA was initially formed with Ahri, Akali, Evelynn, and Kai’Sa. Their first song, Popstars, was such a hit that, later on, they made a new hip-hop group called True Damage. True Damage consists of champions like Ekko, Yasuo, Akali, Senna, & Qiyana. While their first song, Giants, was an instant success, it didn’t reach the same heights as Popstars.</p><p>Later down the years, Riot brought back bands like Pentakill and K/DA with new songs and skins. However, we didn’t see any new bands released by Riot Games. But recently, they made a new boyband called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Heartsteel</a>. Not only that, but they also released a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new song, Paranoia</a>, and some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new skins</a>. And to celebrate the release of this new band, Riot is going to release a mythic variant of one of the most beloved True Damage members, Ekko. That mythic skin is called <strong>Breakout True Damage Ekko</strong>.</p><p>This mythic Ekko skin is similar to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dark Cosmic Erasure Jhin</a>, where it is just a VFX and model overhaul over the base legendary skin. The animations, voice-over, and everything else are the same as the base True Damage Skin. With that said, similar to Dark Cosmic Erasure Jhin, this skin is not worth it to purchase.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Heartsteel Kayn Legendary Skin</a>.</p><h2 id=breakout-true-damage-ekko class="rb-heading-index-0 wp-block-heading">Breakout True Damage Ekko</h2><h3 id=splash-art class="rb-heading-index-1 wp-block-heading">Splash Art</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gameriv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Breakout-True-Damage-Ekko-1200x675.jpeg><h3 id=breakout-true-damage-ekko-price class="rb-heading-index-2 wp-block-heading">Breakout True Damage Ekko Price</h3><p>The only way you can get the True Damage skin is through the opening a specific capsule. While there is a small percentage to get the skin from the get-go, on the 30th open, you are guaranteed the mythic skin. If you were to open the capsule 30 different times, it would cost you $200. It is still absurd for a skin, let alone a recolor, to cost this much. Due to these reasons, I would advise against buying this skin.</p><h3 id=release-date class="rb-heading-index-3 wp-block-heading">Release Date</h3><p>The Breakout True Damage Ekko mythic skin will be released alongside the Heartsteel skins in <strong>Patch 13.22</strong>, scheduled for <strong>Wednesday, November 8, 2023</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifkaKys7XVZ5qopV%2BXv6atyqisrWWkp8KmecOapJqflWKyrLfOZqSyrJiesG6%2FyqKlZqugoa60tIyaqa1loKe2pLGMq5ylnZGosm6wwK2caA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
