To celebrate today, we decided to talk about cats and cat influencers, one of the sweetest members of the animal kingdom. With a history of 12 thousand years, cats have managed to become the closest friends of humans. It is possible to see the reflections of this strong bond between cats and humans on the internet. Over the years, cats have literally dominated the internet. It seems that they are no longer just our furry friends, but an integral part of our culture.</p><h2>The Rise of Cat Influencers</h2><p>When you think of influencers, the first thing that comes to mind is people who share their experiences in fashion, travel, food and drink, and healthy living. However, cat accounts are at least as popular as their human counterparts. Many of them even have more followers than the influencers we are used to. According to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> conducted by Telegraph, around one in ten cats in the UK has their own social media account. Considering that this number is increasing day by day; It is no longer enough for us to only share pictures of our cats on social media, they also need to have their own social media accounts.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/inflownetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cat-influencers3-1024x576.jpg alt="the best cat influencers" width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>What drives brands to collaborate with popular cat influencers on social media?</h2><p>Cats are with us everywhere in our lives, which is why they also found their way into social media. But what’s behind the success of cat influencers on social media? Let’s look at the 3 reasons why cat influencers are increasingly preferred by brands.</p><h2>Appealing to the Emotions</h2><p>It has long been known that cats have many positive effects on people’s mental and physical health. However, many of us are unaware that looking at photos of our furry felines also evoke emotions similar to those we experience when spending time with them. Whether they’re next to you or on your screen, cats reduce stress, anxiety and depression. This is exactly why brands prefer to work with popular cat influencers on social media. The emotions that cats evoke in humans work as an emotional stimulus that evokes positive emotions about the brand’s product. In other words, advertisements and collaborations featuring cats create positive brand associations in the minds of the consumer.</p><p>Many successful brands position their products to create these positive associations. Because, in the long run, customers’ feelings about the brand turn into loyalty towards the brand, allowing the brand to stand out from its competitors.</p><h2>Cat Influencers Have High Engagement Rates</h2><p>Cat influencers have thousands or even millions of followers. As a result, these accounts have a huge power to reach and influence people. In addition, cat influencers have higher engagement rates than humans – even when they both have the same reach. On social media, content featuring pets simply works better than human-centered content because people are more likely to tag friends to cat content. It seems like people have a lot to say about cats, and it doesn’t look like it will end anytime soon.</p><h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/inflownetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cat-influencers-1024x576.jpg alt="cat influencers and engagement rates" width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></h2><h2>Unique Content</h2><p>Originality is a key factor in influencers’ success on social media. Many of the cat influencers are also aware of this. They know the importance of preserving authenticity in their posts. As a result, their brand collaborations do not appear to people like ads that are forced into the feed. As long as the content is original, people don’t seem to mind a few promotions.</p><h2>The Cat Influencers You Must Follow</h2><p>You can put the influencers of your interest on your radar and maybe ignore the others.
