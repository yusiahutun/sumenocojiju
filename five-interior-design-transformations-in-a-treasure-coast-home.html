One glance at the before-and-after pictures and onlookers might not realize it is the same house.</p><p>“There’s a lot more light and a feeling of openness,” Francesca Morgan, owner of Francesca Morgan Interiors in Stuart, says of the dining room, which leads out to the patio and pool. “Your view now is panoramic.”</p><p>Morgan achieved this by running the window treatments from the ceiling to the floor, creating hefty height. Establishing a flow between the dining room and living room resulted in added volume.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2020/03/dining_room_before.jpg><p>“I think a lot of people know when I do a room because of the window treatments,” she says. “It makes the room. That’s the wow right there—sort of like the icing on the cake.”</p><p>She selected a coastal print and paired it with a cool solid—both in linen for an airy softness that fulfilled her client’s vision. An orb chandelier hangs above the 10-top table.</p><p>“I love this room,” she says. “It showcases the architecture.”</p><p>“It was a little bit daunting, and it ended up being something&nbsp;I was extremely proud of and they were very happy with.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2020/03/kitchen_after.jpg><p>The strange color was unappetizing, the wood cabinets were unappealing, and the dingy floor was unsightly. None of it made for a pleasant kitchen. Still, Bianca Fathauer, owner of Splendid Home Design in Stuart, saw it had promise.</p><p>“Usually, clients who come in to see me want to replace all of their cabinets,” Fathauer says. “We added cabinets by matching and painting them.”</p><p>The strange color appeared in a trapped space adorned with odd plates and platters. By installing extra cabinets and making them white with opaque glass, Fathauer was able to imbue the kitchen with a clean and inviting look.</p><p>“Sometimes with remodels, you go into it thinking you have to gut absolutely everything,” she says. “Seventy-five percent is old cabinets.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2020/03/kitchen_before.jpg><p>Faux-wood tile contrasts nicely with the island—painted in Sherwin-Williams’ ‘Tin Lizzie’—and chunky barstools.</p><p>“It was a little bit daunting, and it ended up being something I was extremely proud of and they were very happy with,” she says.</p><p>She posted photos of the redesign on Facebook, Instagram and her website.</p><p>“We got so many comments,” she says. “People really liked it.”</p><p>“We decided to go with sleek furniture and brighten it up with the decor.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2020/03/guest_bedroom_after.jpg><p>Mix-matched, poorly placed furniture, including a full-size bed crammed into a corner, comprised a space that was supposed to be a retreat for family and friends. Instead, the mashup of random items made it more like an obstacle course than a guest bedroom.</p><p>“Their floorplan obviously was not working,” says Baylee Floyd, owner of Baylee Deyon Interior Design in Palm City. “The whole room was confused.”</p><p>Floyd’s client frequently hosts out-of-town visitors and wanted to transform the room into a tropical oasis with a bohemian vibe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2020/03/guest_bedroom_before.jpg><p>“They needed something that accommodated everyone and felt serene and at home,” she says. “We decided to go with sleek furniture and brighten it up with the decor.”</p><p>The accessories include beaded table lamps etched in a black-and-white, hieroglyphics-like pattern as well as a colorful area rug with a similar global-inspired theme. A vase filled with pampas grass adds a whimsical dimension, and an earthy-green accent wall ties it all together.</p><p>“It’s boho, but we went with all-white bedding to give it that hotel feel,” she says. “It’s welcoming now.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tMDUmqmtpZGcrru1zZ5lnKedZMC1wcCrq2akmZuycK3TZp%2BopZVks6rCxGagp6yVp7awvoydnKyhl6N6tb7Ap6qfp6KirrW1zqeqZqGeYq5uwNGemKytopp6pLvArKtmoJ%2BisnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
