Founded by Larry Wang and Guo Xinghua last August, Shanghai-based start-up FoloToy has partnered with over a dozen toymakers to use large language models (LLMs) – the technology that underpins intelligent bots such as ChatGPT – to upgrade toy designs and sell new products to consumers in China and overseas."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Together, they launched a limited-edition “live” figure, Frank Murphy, designed to chat in six languages, including English, Chinese and Japanese.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Launched in December, this AI-enabled companion toy sells for 5,500 yuan (US$770).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A demonstration video posted by Yomiplanet on WeChat showed a person asking Frank what Apple founder Steve Jobs would say about the “world’s first AI toy figure”. Jobs might have said it was a rather “eye-catching technological breakthrough”, the figure answered.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Amid Washington’s tightened export restrictions on AI chips, open-sourced LLMs from the US have given smaller Chinese start-ups such as FoloToys unprecedented opportunities to come up with new uses for the fast-developing technology, even though these companies may not be as resourceful as Big Tech firms, with their abundant manpower and coffers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Open-sourced models and application programming interfaces provided by ChatGPT and similar services allow developers to integrate advanced models into their own apps.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are standing on the shoulders of giants,” Wang said. “We can accomplish many things that could only be achievable at big companies in the past.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But it remains a challenge for companies to make money from their AI creations. The commercialisation of AI is particularly difficult, Li Di, CEO of Microsoft AI chatbot spin-off Xiaoice, warned at a forum in December.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Why China is still several moves behind in the AI chess game started by ChatGPT</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wang’s focus on hardware, rather than purely software, puts it among a string of start-ups betting on AI to give themselves an edge over traditional smart gadget manufacturers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Around the world, both new entrants and established tech giants are racing to develop consumer devices powered by the next generation of AI technology, which some people believe can revolutionise the way humans and machines interact and transcend the app-focused experience offered by today’s smartphones.</p>Humane, a Silicon Valley start-up founded by former Apple employees who worked on the iPhone, in November unveiled the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Ai Pin – a small screenless device</span></a> that interacts with users through an AI virtual assistant.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While companies pursuing AI-related ventures have been experimenting with different business models, no one is certain yet about how to go forward, according to FoloToy’s Wang said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But “AI doesn’t need to be that serious – it can be fun, too”, he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwaavx2irnpuYYsGzsc2dqmiZoqm2pLjEaGprbWFpfnp7wKJkqaenmr%2BmsIybrKemmZrAbrjIr5xmnpmcwrOx0maqrZmiqXqzscinrZ6mpKh6tLnAq6tmrJ%2BuwG6vx5qroKikYsGmr8dmmKecXZi1qrrAZpueq5mcu6awjJyfoqij</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
