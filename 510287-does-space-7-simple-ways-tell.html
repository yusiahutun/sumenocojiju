It is natural to be confused about the main reason behind his need for space, but there are some simple ways to determine this. Explore them to know which is which. Does he need space or is he done?</p><h3>1. He's stressed and in a bad mood</h3><p class=align-left>Should you give him space when he's stressed? Yes, if he is dealing with some issues that he needs to deal with on his own, then it's a good idea to give him space if he asks to. Assure him you will be there if he needs someone to talk to.</p><p class=align-left>If you have offered support, but he pushes you away, don't try to confront him about his attitude, as it may lead to more arguments. He is done with the relationship if he forces you out of his life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9b1b8a636b616304.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Signs of unspoken attraction between coworkers to notice</span></p></a><h3>2. Communication changes</h3><p class=align-left>If he asks for space and you give it respectfully, it will reach a point when he wants to be in touch with you again. So if your partner constantly communicates with you, it's a good sign he still wants to be with you.</p><p class=align-left>So does needing space mean it's over? Yes, it may indicate the end of your relationship if he withdraws and become <a href=#>less communicative </a>with you. For instance, he may ignore your phone call or messages.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/76c4bd74a2ebd903.jpg><h3>3. They avoid physical contact</h3><p class=align-left>Physical contact, like hugging and kissing, is important for showing affection. A partner who seems uncomfortable with intimacy or moves away from you when you get close needs space. It can feel like a significant loss at first, but give him space, and he'll come back. Maybe he only needs some space to work out his feelings.</p><p class=align-left>Withdrawing from physical touch could also indicate that he is no longer interested in the relationship. He may also be actively trying to distance himself emotionally and physically from you in the hopes of ending the relationship.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/18d1d2ec68c66732.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>13 signs he thinks you're not good enough for him to date you</span></p></a><h3>4. He doesn't talk about the future</h3><p class=align-left>Does he need space, or is he done? Is your partner talking about the future with you? If he's not talking about the future, he doesn't see you as a good enough match for him. If he seems unwilling to speak or include you in his future plans, giving him space to figure out what he wants might be what he needs.</p><p class=align-left>It's also a sign that he can't make long-term commitments with you or is unsure of his feelings. If he has different goals or priorities than you and avoids discussing the future, it's time to move on from the <a href=#>toxic relationship</a>.</p><h3>5. He argues and fights with you any chance he gets</h3><p class=align-left>Fighting benefits a relationship only when done healthily and constructively. It strengthens the bond as you express your views without violence. It's best to give him space so as to overcome your differences.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/aaad724b82a2fce8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to ask someone to be your boyfriend without sounding weird</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When fighting goes beyond positive criticism, he verbally abuses or physically fights you. It's time to say goodbye to such a relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9b1b8a636b616304.jpg><h3>6. His actions tell that he wants to end the relationship</h3><p class=align-left>How do you know when he's done with you? If he is done with you, he will directly tell you, or you will know through his actions. Does he portray signs of<a href=#> relationship abuse</a>? If yes, it's an obvious sign that he is done with you.</p><p class=align-left>If such a man asks for space, he may be distancing himself and looking for a room to decrease the seriousness of the relationship. It is just an excuse to end things. So carefully pay attention to these signs; if things have worsened, you will feel it too and move on.</p><h3>7. His verbal cues tell</h3><p class=align-left>Does giving a guy space make him miss you? The answer depends on his intentions for needing the space. He will miss you if he wants to clear his mind, but if it were just an excuse to end the relationship, he wouldn't miss you. So if he still tells you he loves or misses you, it's a good sign that he still has feelings for you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/179a71272e2b2899.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ save the date quotes for a wedding: Best, funny, and cute ideas</span></p></a><p class=align-left>If your partner stops saying he misses you frequently, he needs more space and is done. Ultimately, if he expresses a need for space, it's important to respect their wishes and give them the time and support they need, as it is also an opportunity for growth and self-reflection for both of you.</p><h2>Does he need space or is he done? The takeaway</h2><p class=align-left>Having noticed the above signs, the next question that pops into your mind may be; how long does a guy take space for? The time he needs can vary depending on his personality and the situation. He may take hours, days, or months to come back. Does he need space, or is he done? It's a good idea to have an open conversation with him.</p><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke shared a guide on smooth ways to <a href=#>slide into DMs </a>and start a conversation.
