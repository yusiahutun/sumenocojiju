Removing oral bacteria helps reduce the build-up of plaque, strengthens gums, makes breath fresher and helps keep teeth white."</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=eCOqSzWZidW0 data-wc=80>She adds: "Coconut oil has excellent antibacterial and antimicrobial properties and many people find it pleasant tasting. Also, you won’t be able to create individual-sized cubed portions as in this recipe with other oils because they don’t solidify like coconut oil. Each portion is the perfect amount for your daily oil pull and you will have enough to keep you going for at least the next couple of weeks." Here's what you need - the recipe makes about 15 portions…</p><p id=eauRcls41a7O><a class=hm-link href=#>READ MORE:&nbsp;Try this trick and you'll fall asleep in 2 minutes, apparently</a></p><h3>Ingredients:</h3><p id=eXNMHGd2uTUe data-wc=12>460g (1lb) solid coconut oil or 500ml (18fl oz) liquid coconut oil</p><p id=emmKlL-jCtNr data-wc=6>Optional: 20 drops peppermint essential oil</p><p id=eIXEbSorLDqy data-wc=8>You will also need a standard-size ice-cube tray</p><h3>Recipe:</h3><p id=emhb-GGaEppT data-wc=37>If your coconut oil is solid, melt the oil in a bain marie over a gentle heat. Remove from the heat and leave to cool for 10–15 minutes, then stir in the peppermint essential oil, if using.</p><p id=ec11DRr0KydH data-wc=49>Pour into your ice-cube tray and refrigerate for about 1–2 hours or until the oil has solidified. Pop the cubes out of the ice-cube tray and cut each cube in half. Store the cubes in an airtight container in the refrigerator. They will keep for up to a month.</p><h3>To use:</h3><p id=evIqrGkoKlf- data-wc=115>In Ayurveda, it is believed that oil pulling is best done on an empty stomach first thing in the morning. Pop the cube in your mouth (it will turn to liquid on contact) and swill the oil around and throughout your mouth and between your teeth for as close as you can get to 20 minutes. You may find you can only manage 5 minutes at first, but it gets easier! A tip is to oil pull when you’re doing something else so that you have a distraction, such as taking a shower. When you’re done, spit the oil out into the bin, not the sink, as the oil can clog drainpipes when it solidifies.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
