We're going to show you how to download movie trailers for free directly to your computer.</p><h2 id=how-to-download-free-movie-trailers>How to Download Free Movie Trailers</h2><p>There are different ways to download free movie trailers online to your computer. Here are the best methods.</p><h3 id=download-free-movie-trailers-from-hd-trailers>Download Free Movie Trailers From HD-Trailers</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/hd-trailersnet.jpg><p>One of the best places to download free movie trailers from is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HD-Trailers.net</a>.</p><p>This site sources trailers from <a href=#>iTunes Movie Trailers</a>, which is a great site to watch high-definition trailers, thanks to its clean interface and offering of multiple resolutions. However, it isn't as simple to download trailers from iTunes as it is from HD-Trailers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The front page of HD-Trailers lists the newest trailers, the top box office movies, and movies opening this week (this category doesn't appear to be updated though, so you can ignore it). If you don't immediately see the movie that you want to download the trailer for, use the search box at the top.</p><p>Each movie page displays the poster and a brief description. You will see the trailer's links beneath this. Some movies get multiple full-length trailers, alongside other trailer formats like "sneak peek" and "teaser".</p><p>HD-Trailers lists these trailers in date order and in multiple resolutions (which determines the image quality). 480p is the lowest resolution and 1080p is the highest. The higher the resolution, the larger the file size.</p><p>Click the resolution you want and the trailer will play. Under the trailer is a <strong>Download</strong> link. You might be able to click this to initiate the download. However, your browser might just open the trailer in a new tab.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If this happens,<strong> right-click</strong> the <strong>Download</strong> link and click <strong>Save Link As</strong>. Choose where you store the trailer, then click <strong>Save</strong> to begin the download.</p><h3 id=download-free-movie-trailers-from-youtube>Download Free Movie Trailers From YouTube</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/movieclips-trailers-youtube-channel.jpg><p>Chances are whatever movie trailer you want, whether it's for a new or old release, will be available on <a href=#>YouTube</a>. There are lots of channels on YouTube dedicated to uploading movie trailers, such as:</p><ul><li><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Movieclips Trailers</a></li><li><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FilmSelect Trailer</a></li><li><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Movie Trailers Source</a></li></ul><p>Individual studios will also upload trailers to their channels. That includes the likes of <a href=#>Netflix</a>, <a href=#>Warner Bros. Pictures</a>, and <a href=#>20th Century Studios</a>.</p><p>Of course, rather than going to specific channels, you can also just search for the trailers you need.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>YouTube doesn't offer an inbuilt way to download videos. As such, you will need to use a third-party tool. Handily, there are <a href=#>lots of great YouTube downloaders</a>.</p><p>One of the best is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">4K Video Downloader</a>, which is free and available on Windows, Mac, and Linux. You simply plug the YouTube video URL into the program and it downloads it to your computer. It even supports playlists and subtitles.</p><p>While other programs might download at a low resolution or be riddled with adverts, 4K Video Downloader is simple and efficient. There's no better way to download movie trailers from YouTube.</p><h3 id=download-free-movie-trailers-from-internet-archive>Download Free Movie Trailers From Internet Archive</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/internet-archive-movie-trailers.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you are looking to download some more obscure movie trailers, you might find what you need at <a href=#>Internet Archive</a>. Thousands of trailers are stored here, most from the 20th century.</p><p>The pane on the left helps you sort the trailers through categories like <strong>Year</strong>, <strong>Topics & Subjects</strong>, and <strong>Collection</strong>. You can also use the search at the top, though note that sometimes the trailers are unhelpfully named as they are user uploaded.</p><p>When you find a trailer you want, click the tile to visit its respective page. The trailer can be played at the top of the page. Beneath that, look for the <strong>Download options</strong> box. Here you can download the trailer, often in multiple formats like MOV or WMV.</p><h2 id=how-to-play-downloaded-movie-trailers>How to Play Downloaded Movie Trailers</h2><p>Once you download the movie trailer, you'll want to play it. Your computer has a video player by default. Windows uses the <strong>Movies & TV</strong> app (though there are <a href=#>alternative media players for Windows</a>), while for Mac it's <strong>QuickTime Player</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The best for both operating systems is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">VLC Media Player</a>. This is a free, open-source, cross-platform media player that supports a huge variety of video formats. Also, <a href=#>VLC is packed full of handy features</a>.</p><p>Since the movie trailers you download might be in different file formats, VLC is so useful because it will play most things you chuck at it. You won't need to mess around with downloading codecs either.</p><h2 id=how-to-convert-downloaded-movie-trailers-to-different-file-formats>How to Convert Downloaded Movie Trailers to Different File Formats</h2><p>The movie trailers you download will come in different video formats. Examples include MP4, WMV, FLV, and AVI.</p><p>As mentioned above, VLC will handle most video formats. However, you might want to convert the trailers into a different file format. This is vital if you want to transfer the trailer to a device that doesn't support the video's format natively (this is likely to happen on a smart TV, for example).</p><p>If this is the case, don't worry. It's easy to convert your downloaded movie trailer into a different file format. All you need is a <a href=#>video conversion tool</a>. In fact, you can also use VLC to convert the media file.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Open VLC and go to <strong>Media > Convert/Save</strong>. Click <strong>Add</strong> to select the trailer, then click <strong>Convert/Save</strong>. Specify the <strong>Profile</strong> (the output format) and the <strong>Destination file</strong>. When ready, click <strong>Start</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/winff.jpg><p>Another great choice is <a href=#>WinFF</a>. This is a simple and free tool that can convert videos in bulk into many formats. With the program open, click <strong>Add</strong> to select the trailer, choose your <strong>Convert to</strong> and <strong>Preset</strong> formats, then specify the <strong>Output Folder</strong>. When ready, click <strong>Convert</strong>.</p><h2 id=find-a-movie-worth-watching>Find a Movie Worth Watching</h2><p>Now you know how easy it is to download movie trailers for free, you can build your own collection of your favorite trailers. Trailers also make for a good way to decide what movie to see next, whether you're off to the theater or browsing through a streaming service like Netflix.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fnbG1vsCio56qo2KxsMPNpaaanF2bv6axjKamr6GVYsGzrcilnKurXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
