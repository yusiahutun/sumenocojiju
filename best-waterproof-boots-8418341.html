When the weather gets dire, we just can’t risk getting our regular <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ankle booties</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>knee-high boots</a> soaked and damaged or, even worse, having to spend the rest of our day with cold, damp socks. That’s where waterproof boots come in to save the day.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A good waterproof boot needs to hold up in wet conditions, keeping out moisture and our feet dry&nbsp;— and many times, they’ll also need to work double-duty as our indoor shoes, so the look is equally as important. But as waterproof boots range in style and type, there’s much to consider when shopping for a pair, like what exact conditions you need them for. A rainy walk to the subway, or a hike through muddy and wet terrain?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That’s why we put 64 of today’s top-rated waterproof boots up to the test — scuttling through rainstorms, trekking through mud, and even willingly hopping into ankle-deep puddles — to determine which ones are truly the real deal (not just water-resistant) and kept our feet dry and comfortable. Waterproofing aside, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>we asked our testers to evaluate</a> the boots based on several other factors, such as <strong>traction, durability, fit, comfort, and overall value</strong>. We also tapped a team of experts — footwear design consultants, textile experts, stylists, and hikers — to share their insights. Whether you’re planning a rainy day hike or need a shoe that’ll keep you dry on your morning commute, there’s a waterproof boot for you, ahead.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-ugg-brisbane-waterproof-chelsea-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ugg Brisbane Waterproof Chelsea Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Ugg Brisbane Chelsea Ankle Boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/vI8Ub-hg8IPm2Na-VihfjhoW1OM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ugg-brisbane-chelsea-ankle-boot-d31dc853de8a4d8b8e9e189dfb1ddade.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These are an overall solid choice for weathering the rain and any other wet outdoor conditions — they’re truly waterproof, have superior traction on all sorts of surfaces and terrains, have a durable design that’s built to last, and they’re stylish.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They take some time to break in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of the many boots we tested, these Chelsea boots from Ugg take the cake as our overall top pick. From a waterproof standpoint, they were quite impressive. We put them through the wringer — traversing a rainstorm, even stomping around in an ankle-deep puddle — and experienced <strong>no water </strong>entering the boot whatsoever, not even from the feather edges or where the different panels meet one another, and we were amazed at how well water beaded off of the waterproof suede upper.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Every aspect of this boot is designed with superior quality, from the rubber sole to the pull tab to the plush and cushy shearling-like footbed. The extra-thick soles have great traction on all sorts of terrains and surfaces — we wore them on everything from grass and gravel to cement and tile and never once felt like we might slip. As such, they’re slightly heavier and take a little time to break in, but we can tell that these durable boots were built to last us a long time — they showed <strong>no signs of wear and tear whatsoever at the end of our testing period</strong>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’d typically expect to pay a pretty penny for a boot this well-designed that we’ll surely get years of wear out of, and we think these bear a pretty <strong>affordable</strong> price tag for what you get. Of course, it doesn’t hurt that they’re quite an attractive shoe, too. The <strong>ultra-chunky lug sole</strong> is very on-trend, and we were surprised that a waterproof boot this functional could be this stylish and didn’t require being crafted entirely of rubber. But while we appreciate the two trendy colorways in moss and mustard, we would love to see it in black for more styling versatility.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Waterproof suede upper; plush wool-blend lining; and rubber sole | <strong>Colors: </strong>2 | <strong>Size: </strong>5–11</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-asgard-womens-chelsea-ankle-waterproof-rain-boots></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Asgard Chelsea Ankle Waterproof Rain Boots</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Asgard Women's Waterproof Chelsea Rain Boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/H7Ew7GBk5OdnTPyWwKzsh2sG8h4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/amazon-vivere-asgard-womens-waterproof-chelsea-rain-boot-ee370d2e42204c30956d013650b4aafb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These affordable boots are heavy-duty, providing great traction and waterproofing capabilities through rainy, wet, and muddy conditions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They could benefit from improved cushioning and arch support.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Durable, well-performing boots that will keep water and moisture out while maintaining their integrity shouldn’t have to break the bank, something we learned after taking these Asgard rain boots for a spin. We scored it a perfect five from both a performance and waterproof standpoint.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Made of <strong>heavy-duty — but not heavy to wear&nbsp;— rubber,</strong> they’re sturdy yet easy to pull on and off, thanks to the pull tab. They’re truly waterproof, too, keeping our feet perfectly dry as we traversed rainstorms (which included a fair share of puddles and flooding gutters) and even traipsed through a muddy pumpkin patch and sunflower field, providing great traction without being overly grippy. We found that they’re <strong>durable enough for their purpose</strong> and <strong>don’t require any breaking in</strong> (something we credit partially to the <strong>elastic gussets</strong>). From a style standpoint, we appreciate that they come in 15 different colorways to suit any wardrobe, whether you prefer bold brights or neutral hues.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, we have no complaints and think they’re a great choice for anyone who has to walk both short and long distances in the rain, though we think they could be even better with improved footbed cushioning and arch support for when we’ll be wearing these for days (or weeks) at a time.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>PVC upper; EVA foam insole; and rubber sole | <strong>Colors: </strong>15 | <strong>Size:</strong> 4–12</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-durable-bogs-womens-holly-lace-leather-boots></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Durable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bogs Holly Lace Leather Boots</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bogs Women's Holly Lace Leather Boots" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0EyWE-lxydifVoXTA2RE7GAZAKY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Bogs-Womens-Holly-Lace-Leather-Boots-8d37151ade404c5a9f9d564e5fca968c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bogs</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These stylish hiking boots keep feet dry, provide excellent grip, and can withstand tough terrains without so much as a scratch.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They’re somewhat stiff at first, softening up the more we wear them.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Those who prefer the look of hiking boots will appreciate these stylish lace-ups from outdoor footwear brand Bogs. We tested them through rain and shine and found that the <strong>cushy, arch-supporting footbed</strong> kept our feet comfortable even after full days of wear; just keep in mind that they’re somewhat stiff out of the box and soften up as you wear them. In terms of waterproofing, these are excellent at repelling water in rain, puddles, and even while standing ankle-deep at the edge of a lake. But unlike other boots where water physically beads off, the <strong>waterproof suede upper</strong> on these will look wet, though they dry rather quickly and, trust, feet remain perfectly dry throughout.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Where this pair really shines is in durability. Rain and lakes aside, they held up well when we wore them for days at a time in outdoor terrains, not showing so much as a scratch even after navigating grassy wooded areas dense in sticks and branches — something that, in our opinion, is particularly impressive considering how fussy suede can be. The <strong>thick rubber sole</strong> (lug-soled and slightly heeled for a trendy look) provides great traction on wet and dry pavement alike, also adding to the boot’s durability. Overall, they’re pretty <strong>heavy-duty, meaning they aren’t the most breathable boots</strong> out there, but fear not: They feature the brand’s sweat-evaporating Max-Wick technology to keep feet dry while a natural biotechnology treatment helps keep odor at bay — a much-appreciated bonus.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Waterproof leather upper; algae-based footbed; and recycled PET lining | <strong>Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Size: </strong>6–11<br></p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-6 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2638 data-sizes=750px alt="The Bogs Holly Lace Leather Boots in water" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/aQ5UQYADBD10vXgGQkI2547x3BM=/fit-in/1500x2638/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-womens-waterproof-boots-test-bogs-holly-lace-leather-kristin-cleveland-23-5bb872e0aaf146c795fa584ebc353ae4.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Kristin Cleveland</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-7 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2628 data-sizes=750px alt="The top of the Bogs Holly Lace Leather Boot" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BMkEwiF-WiFco1TUZZJhp9E7UDg=/fit-in/1500x2628/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-womens-waterproof-boots-test-bogs-holly-lace-leather-kristin-cleveland-8-f0e4a3c8943846668f9a8b712b9e14d7.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Kristin Cleveland</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-everyday-everlane-the-womens-rain-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Everyday</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane Rain Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Women Rain Boot Tawny Brown" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/qBlGhRvDB1u_xO8Pfls3DNJETxY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/women-rain-boot-tawny-brown-00847436f1534387aff6f458b3193279.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Everlane</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These rubber boots are great for everyday needs — they keep feet dry, provide excellent grip, and are affordable.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They’re somewhat tight on wider feet and aren’t available in wide or half sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a basic, everyday <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>rain boot</a> that, from a style standpoint, is elevated (without an elevated price tag), you can’t go wrong with these rubber boots from Everlane. Ankle-height, they’re built with <strong>a slip-resistant tread</strong> and a cushioned, arch-supporting insole for comfortable walking in slick conditions, while pull tabs and stretchy side panels make them easier to slide on and off — a plus for an everyday boot, in our opinion. We found them to have a sturdy construction with excellent grip on both rainy New York City streets and muddy UK walking paths, and thanks to rubber lining behind the elastic panels, our feet stayed completely dry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We scored these a perfect five across the boards aside from fit, which we found to be a little tight width-wise. If these were available in wide sizing and half sizes, we think they would be more accommodating for those with wider foot shapes. For a stylish and functional boot, they’re well-priced, ringing in at <strong>under $100</strong>, yet they’re a step above some of the cheaper options we’ve tried in the past thanks to substantial tread and padded footbed. Just keep in mind that they only come in four earth tones, so those hoping for basic black will need to look elsewhere.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Rubber | <strong>Colors: </strong>5 | <strong>Size:</strong> 5–11<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shearling-lined-ugg-adirondack-iii-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Shearling-Lined</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ugg Adirondack III Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Ugg Adirondack III Waterproof Bootie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/LlmCYFyukViXVqyo3NtS3rOGjK0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ugg-adirondack-iii-waterproof-bootie-3045a7fa083540b198dbde5d3335a8b0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There's no break-in period, and the boots are light and comfortable.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>With higher quality comes a higher price tag.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When we started wearing these best-selling Ugg boots, from running errands to taking long walks, they wowed us pretty much immediately. Worn with or without socks, these sherpa-lined boots are <strong>extra cozy and have a solid (but not too rigid) construction</strong>. We sized up a half size, and we're glad we did, since the extra room in the toe box made for a more comfortable fit and kept blisters at bay despite walking around in them for hours. Considering their durability and warmth, we also love that they're lighter than a lot of other snow boots. We tested their waterproof capabilities and traction, and the Adirondack III passed both with flying colors. These will be a must-have addition to our suitcases when we go on ski trips (according to the website, they're cold-weather ratified to -32 degrees Celsius), as well as inclement weather days closer to home.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These are a bit <strong>splurge-y relative to others on our list,</strong> but they're going to last you years — so the price-per-wear is low (if you've ever had a pair of Ugg boots, you'll know this already). Luxury specialist <a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Kristen Shirley</a> loves Ugg boots because they can be worn practically and also as a street-style staple, meaning that they're deeply multifunctional.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather upper; wool and lyocell lining, and rubber outsole | <strong>Colors: </strong>6 | <strong>Size:</strong> 5–12</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-snow-sorel-womens-caribou-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Snow</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sorel Caribou Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon sorel-womens-caribou-waterproof-boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/HPsqlxXxY_973hG0N41q-1GkHfk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sorel-womens-caribou-waterproof-boot-f23087a11c5d49ca83527a5ccecd0531.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It has the typical Sorel quality and durability, but it's also lightweight.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It's an investment (even if a worthwhile one).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sorel's pretty well-known for its high-performing snow boots, but we’re calling out this one because <strong>it performed on gravel, grass, dirt, and concrete</strong> as well — and for extended periods of time, including on hikes and long walks. We see this style as one we can totally use in the coldest, most inclement times of the year. Of course, it also helps that the black color with subtle white accents is sleek and versatile.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The fit is true to size (especially if you'd like to wear bulkier socks) and the construction at the ankle and calf is sturdy. It's <strong>not a breathable boot</strong> — since it's made for warmth, after all — and there's no break-in period. Unlike some Sorel models, the Caribou is pretty light; we wore a pair for a full day at the office without feeling weighed down by them. With that said, though, this might not be our first choice for a day spent indoors: These are boots designed to weather the elements outside, including an impressive waterproof outer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our favorite part might be the height. These go up to the lower or mid-calf, depending on your height — not so high that they feel burdensome. They're also easy to get on and off, meaning they're a perfect everyday pick for throwing on to go outside.

These boots from Hi-Tec have all that and more — and with <strong>a shockingly affordable price tag</strong>. They’re among the few pairs on this list that warranted a perfect score across all categories.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For starters, they’re so comfortable. The lining is made with a slow recovery foam that makes even more intense hikes ultra comfortable, and we found that it provided <strong>great support to the arches and balls of our feet</strong>. The outside of the shoe is sturdy and solid without being too heavy (another important factor if you’ll be trudging up hills and mountains). We also found that they have <strong>excellent traction on wet ground, metal sidewalk grates, and leaves alike</strong>. But we were most impressed with its waterproofing capabilities — we were shocked that even after standing with our feet submerged in a puddle, not one drop of water ended up inside the shoe; not through the leather upper or the breathable textile panels. Overall, the quality of these boots is top-notch, especially considering the price point falls well under $100. Considering they also have a stain-resistant shield and rust-proof hardware, we expect these to last us for a long time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather upper; rubber outsole; and rustproof hardware | <strong>Colors: </strong>2 | <strong>Size: </strong>6–11; medium and wide</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-hiking-runner-up-keen-womens-revel-iv-polar-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Hiking, Runner-Up</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Keen Revel IV Polar Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=624 data-sizes=750px alt="Keen Womens Revel IV Polar Boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/GIeUuCszx-4SYLK8u2EnngCx7ds=/fit-in/1500x624/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Photo-69c19bddecc14d65b8c7bf7cf3ec4971.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>REI</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The style boasts all of the benefits of an outdoor boot with added versatility.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The bulkiness, which takes a bit of time to get used to.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This best seller is, according to Keen’s website, warmth-tested to -25 degrees. This is supported by our experience: When we took these boots on a two-hour-long cold-weather hike and did yard work for hours, they remained <strong>comfortable and supportive no matter what</strong>. They also match our outdoorsy casual outfits, so they're just as stylish when we take a quick stroll or a trip to the local brewery.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Keen Revel IVs fit true to size and work well with medium-weight socks. <strong>The traction is, in a word, “impeccable,”</strong> including when we tried sliding down slick rock (where the traction can fail easily). We loved that they're essentially interchangeable with hiking boots — meaning that we can take one pair instead of two on cold-weather trips — but they'll still stand up to rain, snow, and the deep puddles we find on hikes. Those of us who love our classic Merrell boots found that these were just as good, if not a little more durable. But the most underrated aspect of the boot might be its fit. Designer and sewist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Aaronica B. Cole</a> appreciates the easy slip-on construction, and <strong>they work even for wider feet</strong> like hers. We also found that orthotics fit inside this shoe easily, meaning there's room throughout the insole and in the toe box.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Waterproof leather and performance mesh upper; KEEN.Warm Recycled PET insulation; and EVA outsole | <strong>Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Size:</strong> 5–12</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-18 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2453 data-sizes=750px alt="The front of the Keen Womenâs Revel IV Polar Boots" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/l9Wec59rPfjh5mVoffmPXR9PUKI=/fit-in/1500x2453/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-womens-snow-boots-test-keen-revel-iv-polar-tara-massouleh-mccay-1-d2bab8d8747e44739810e460494eb213.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Tara Massouleh McCay</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="The back of the Keen Women’s Revel IV Polar Boots" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/rIt3NyMvy1Vx_hclm-eeJLZwAHM=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-womens-snow-boots-test-keen-revel-iv-polar-tara-massouleh-mccay-10-b5e760565a8e47ab94cf1e6c55529f3b.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Tara Massouleh McCay</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-classic-hunter-womens-original-short-rain-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Classic</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hunter Short Rain Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="DSW Hunter Original Short Waterproof Rain Boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4YVc9AOz1Q8d4gFJjOHSnBMAA50=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hunter-original-short-waterproof-rain-boot-aef9e377adda4ccf980a0019f70cf4b0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>DSW</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These classic wellies are durable and functional, and we appreciate the buckle that allows us to tighten or loosen the fit.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They’re not very breathable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Is there anything more classic than the Hunter’s Original Short Rain Boots? These quintessential wellies are beloved by the masses, and after we took them for a spin through dewy grass and pouring rain ourselves, we can certainly see why.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">First things first, despite the name, we wouldn’t necessarily consider these “short.” They hit at about <strong>mid-calf</strong>, thoroughly protecting us from mystery city puddles (...you never really know how deep they are). In terms of durability, we consider them pretty substantial — not so heavy that they weigh us down, but not so thin that we fear a twig or other debris will pierce or scratch the upper. The <strong>slip-resistant soles</strong> are ideal for rainy days, and we found them to have an equally excellent grip on wet grass and wet pavement.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">They’re also quite comfortable: They’re easy to slide on and off and feature cushioning for extra comfort (though we wouldn’t call it arch support). One feature we really appreciate is the <strong>adjustable buckle</strong>, allowing us to to tighten or loosen them as we please. Just remember that, like most rubber boots, they’re not the most breathable; we found that even though our feet were completely protected from outside moisture, our feet felt a little sweaty after an hour or so of wear, so we wouldn’t recommend wearing these for a full day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Rubber | <strong>Colors: </strong>30 | <strong>Size: </strong>5–11</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-high-heel-la-canadienne-ellenor-leather-bootie></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best High-Heel</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>La Canadienne Ellenor Leather Bootie</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="La Canadienne Ellenor Leather Bootie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ZyvIhcAcAUq_rvQ3VAzMyB5ijRA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/La-Canadienne-Ellenor-Leather-Bootie-92cde39c432947bc8f02e6dd8bb50eb0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>La Canadienne</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These heeled waterproof booties are sleek and stylish; they don’t look like waterproof boots.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They run a bit small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A little inclement weather doesn’t necessarily have to derail our outfit plans and prevent us from wearing our favorite heels, something we discovered thanks to these La Canadienne booties. They’re undeniably an investment, but one we think is well worth it. Here’s why: A luxurious marriage of <strong>fashion and function</strong>, these are handy boots if you’re on the run in the rain and not trying to change shoes once you arrive at your destination. Style-wise, they’re as sleek as can be: <strong>an ankle-height leather bootie</strong> featuring a sculptural skinny heel and an almond toe that’s appropriate for both day and night (we wore them both to the office and on nights out) and an interior side zipper for easy on, easy off. Moreover, they also have a cushioned memory foam insole that makes the <strong>3-inch heel</strong> especially comfortable — however, they run a little small, so keep that in mind when deciding on a size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Looks aside, they’re perfectly suitable for slick, rainy conditions. The <strong>treated waterproof leather</strong> does its job, while <strong>a breathable, microfiber lining</strong> ensures our feet don’t sweat despite being oh-so-soft and fleece-like. The shaft is also quite fitted, so we didn’t experience any rain seeping into the boot. Because they’re equipped with a rubber sole, they provide great traction on slippery pavement, and you won’t need to worry about getting them resoled as often as your other leather shoes&nbsp;— not to mention, we noticed no scuffing or wear whatsoever after testing these out. Even the bottom of the shoe looks practically new after over ten wears.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather upper; leather and rubber sole; and microfiber lining | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Size: </strong>5–13</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-fleece-lined-lands-end-womens-insulated-sherpa-fleece-lined-duck-boots></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Fleece-Lined</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lands' End Sherpa Fleece Lined Duck Boots</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lands End Women's Insulated Sherpa Fleece Lined Duck Boots" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OwVzdTdYFPYu_kcIwDID7-GQDiE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Lands-End-Womens-Insulated-Sherpa-Fleece-Lined-Duck-Boots-288f6fdeb01548f9a1a25c5f329b225c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lands End&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These cozy fleece-lined boots are truly waterproof, and we appreciate how comfortable they are.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They’re somewhat stiff, making them a little difficult to pull on and off.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These lace-up sherpa-lined duck boots from Land’s End were an instant favorite: a cozy, waterproof option that’s comfortable to wear right out of the box. We found that they don’t require any breaking in, but because they are <strong>quite sturdy</strong> boots, pulling them on and off is a little tough, particularly due to the stiff tongue — even so, we found them to be much more flexible and comfy than classic rubber rain boots. They’re on the thicker, bulkier side — as you would expect from a winter boot — but they’re not at all as heavy as we suspected.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">From a functionality standpoint, they have <strong>great waterproofing and traction</strong>; we felt secure walking in light rain and after bigger rainstorms on wet pavement and grass. The rubber parts of the shoe were great in the rain and easily wiped clean of any mud, and because they can be tied securely to fit your leg, we didn’t experience any water entering the boot, even around the top. The outer fleece detail isn’t as waterproof as rubber, of course, but it dried fairly quickly once we got home. All that’s to say, these are an excellent cozy choice for light rain or snow, but we wouldn’t recommend them for a monsoon or trudging through ankle-deep snow unless you’re okay with the outer looking wet for a short period of time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Textile and leather shaft; rubber shell and outsole; and sherpa fleece lining and footbed | <strong>Colors: </strong>2 | <strong>Size: </strong>6–11</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-27 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=1942 data-sizes=750px alt="A person wears the Lands End Women's Insulated Sherpa Fleece Lined Duck Boots" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/DWhULb8nGICcFb74CIvKqYAtNS4=/fit-in/1500x1942/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-womens-waterproof-boots-test-lands-end-insulated-sherpa-fleece-lined-duck-jamie-hergenrader-12-24232b79a03a492d8aaa96484a48da99.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Jamie Hergenrader</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2268 data-sizes=750px alt="The Lands End Women's Insulated Sherpa Fleece Lined Duck Boots" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Vt1E-ARqlc14UE1wl_axX8QB8-0=/fit-in/1500x2268/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-womens-waterproof-boots-test-lands-end-insulated-sherpa-fleece-lined-duck-jamie-hergenrader-02-8d8d3540b9024fd3af4a46651ad3a168.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Jamie Hergenrader</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-duck-llbean-womens-bean-boots-6-inch></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Duck</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L.L.Bean Bean Boots</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="L.L.Bean Original Bean Boot 6&amp;quot;" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/KtdX1fZqzmMzOvE87UhHU1N0sE0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign-2023-08-14T154144.348-8a204fd40aa8473491caada14f40502d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>L.L.

Beans, which earned a perfect score from us. Made from quality rubber and waterproof leather, they’re heavy-duty without being heavy, and we found they were easy to wipe down or hose off after short hikes through the woods in <strong>rainy, muddy conditions</strong>. Thoughtful design features ensured our feet stayed nice and dry; material aside, we appreciated the <strong>sewn-in tongue</strong> that prevents water from seeping in around the laces, while the brand’s iconic chain traction ensured we weren’t slipping or sliding around. In fact, these performed so well that <strong>we plan to wear them with thicker socks in the snow</strong>, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also love that they come in <strong>narrow and wide sizing</strong>, and we found that the wide options perfectly accommodate wide feet. However, you may need to try a few sizes to find the right fit — they run a bit large, and the brand suggests sizing down to varying degrees based on what socks you plan to wear, which could get a little confusing.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Waterproof leather upper and rubber sole | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Size: </strong>5–11; narrow–wide</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-color-options-merry-people-bobbi-rain-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Color Options</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Merry People Bobbi Rain Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bobbi Rain Boot Beetroot Light Pink" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/h5k_tJweOJ8u95gY3Jy18WgvV3M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bobbi-rain-boot-beetroot-light-pink-425f4646c3c0484ab0231653eb9c3366.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Merry People</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These cheery rain boots come in a variety of fun colors and keep feet dry and comfortable.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The removable insoles don’t stay put and pop out of the boot every time we take them off.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Rainy days are notorious mood-ruiners, but these boots and their many color options can make even the bleakest days feel a little more merry and cheerful — we’d say the brand name is appropriate. They’re available in a rainbow array of colors from lime green and lavender in addition to classic, easy-to-match neutrals, meaning there’s <strong>an option to suit anyone’s personal tastes</strong>. Of course, they have plenty more to offer than just being pretty to look at — they go above and beyond your typical waterproof boot.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">They defy the classic trope that rain boots are heavy and clunky. They’re <strong>sturdy and durable</strong>, sure, but we found them to be stylish and far from awkward or bulky. They have chunky, durable soles with <strong>ample traction</strong>, and we once never felt like we’d slip while traipsing through puddles or walking over wet foliage. The neoprene lining allows them to slip on and off easily, while <strong>a cushioned sole provides ample arch support</strong>. Overall, we felt well-supported through light drizzles and heavy rain alike.

They’re designed specifically to adapt to the shape of women’s feet, <strong>built with a soft cuff, cradling anatomical design, and low-density chassis (the structural framework of the shoe)</strong> for excellent stability. We found that they fit true-to-size, pleasantly snug across the top of our feet and around the heel, but still enough room to comfortably wiggle our toes. It doesn’t hurt that they’re lightweight, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">They’re technically hiking shoes, but <strong>they’re not just for hiking</strong> — just ask <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bella Hadid</a>. We consider them a great option for walking, whether long or short distances. Upon taking these for a spin on a few neighborhood walks and errands and then a particularly wet seven-mile hike, our feet were dry and protected, and the grippy sole kept us from sliding on slippery supermarket floors and damp, mossy rocks alike. Water actively beads on the shoes' exterior, ensuring nothing gets in. Still, due to the low sides, we wouldn’t recommend them for any activities where you’ll step in ankle-deep puddles or other bodies of water.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Synthetic/textile upper and inlay sole; rubber outsole<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Size: </strong>5–11<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-block-heel-sorel-womens-joan-now-lace-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Block Heel</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sorel Joan Now Lace Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sorel Women's Joan Now Lace Boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/iVIP42_PLln-Vf10qwDee_SKB8M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sorel-womens-joan-now-lace-boot-7a5912aec8314e189ecc82cd9c2d3f6f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sorel</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These chunky-heeled boots are stylish and functional.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The laces are thin and somewhat weak.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-90 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We found this pair from Sorel to be easy to assimilate into our everyday wardrobes. Made with waterproof leather and suede and designed with D-ring hardware, a crafted welt, and a chunky rubber sole, they’re rain boots that don’t look like rain boots.

We were delighted to discover that, yes, they can. They completely repelled water and we saw no watermarks whatsoever after wearing them, while the large, chunky sole provided excellent traction on slippery surfaces. Despite their <strong>clunky appearance</strong>, they’re surprisingly lightweight, while a pillowy-soft lining keeps feet cozy and warm.

Of all the styles we tried, we found this style from The North Face to have superior support throughout the foot (heel-to-toe and ankles), thanks to <strong>5 millimeters of underfoot cushioning</strong> and <strong>a taller-than-usual shaft</strong>. They were very comfortable when worn all day with periodic movements, such as a day at the office, and when worn for active activities that usually leave us sore, like hiking or doing yard work, they effectively kept us pain-free for hours at a time before we felt any signs of discomfort.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-103 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">They’re durable without feeling overly heavy or clunky and provide excellent traction on all sorts of surfaces — whether on outdoor terrains, a hose-soaked backyard, or a doctor’s office floor, we never once felt like we’d slip. Of course, they’re perfectly waterproof, too, thanks to a breathable membrane that protects moisture from outside and inside the shoe.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-104 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather, synthetic leather, ripstop, and spacer mesh upper; rubber outsole | <strong>Colors: </strong>2 | <strong>Size: </strong>5–11<br></p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-42 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2609 data-sizes=750px alt="A person wears the The North Face Womenâs Hedgehog 3 Mid Waterproof Boots" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/hsiCTsamYzzab1crwSn9XUcHXIM=/fit-in/1500x2609/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-womens-waterproof-boots-test-north-face-hedgehog-3-mid-steven-schrimpf-04-8d5d5257ac8d4a889beed290bd44b412.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Steven Schrimpf</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2632 data-sizes=750px alt="A pair of The North Face Womenâs Hedgehog 3 Mid Waterproof Boots in the box" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ehKqVEWJKih1Jw05NdcJ9EHVIr0=/fit-in/1500x2632/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-womens-waterproof-boots-test-north-face-hedgehog-3-mid-steven-schrimpf-01-bf4449eb0b7a46c69390cdc196bdf1ee.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Steven Schrimpf</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tall-xtratuf-x-salmon-sisters-15-inch-legacy-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Xtratuf x Salmon Sisters Legacy Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Xtratuf x Salmon Sisters Legacy Boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/PcYHUFpuCELhPYhgS_HMcZOPh9k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/xtratuf-salmon-sisters-octopus-15-legacy-boot-783a42b2be9246bfad543c0e79e49e7a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These durable rain boots hit just under the knee, ensuring water doesn’t enter from above.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The outer material has an oily texture.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-108 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’ll be stomping through puddles or wading through any sort of shallow water, a taller boot will do wonders at ensuring water doesn’t enter from the top of the boot. Of all the shoes we tested, we preferred this 15-inch tall classic rain boot that hits just under the knee — which, as the name implies, is extremely tough and durable. We found that they were sturdy and somewhat stiff but still comfortable enough for regular wear, while the rubber sole has a great non-slip grip to it. What’s more, <strong>the shaft rolls down so we can adjust the height</strong> (and reveal a super-cute inner print).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-109 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We think it’s a solid rain boot all around, but the only thing we didn’t care for is the outer texture. The treated neoprene rubber has <strong>an oily treatment that provides excellent waterproof protection</strong> (in addition to being acid- and chemical-resistant) but has a greasy hand feel. To avoid staining your stuff, you’ll want to keep these in the garage or somewhere where they won’t touch your clothes or other shoes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-110 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Neoprene rubber upper; fabric lining; and rubber midsole and outsole | <strong>Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Size: </strong>6–11</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Purpose: </strong>Before you even begin your search for waterproof boots, you should first consider what you’ll actually need to wear them for. “Have a clear idea of your expectation for how you’re going to use and wear the product before you start shopping,” recommends <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Dean Schwartz</a>, footwear designer and co-founder of footwear consulting firm Schwilliamz. “Are you going to be wading through streams on a hardcore hike or just walking through a dewy field on an early morning walk with your dog? Will you be commuting in them and wearing them all day with your office attire? Are you looking for a product that just keeps your feet dry, or do you also need it to look good after using it in wet conditions?” How you answer these questions will help determine what kind of waterproof boot you’ll best benefit from, i.e., a classic rubber rain boot or a more technical outdoor boot that’s equipped for hiking in water, mud, or even snow. “For everyday commuting, your waterproof boots should align with your style,” adds editorial and personal stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Mimi Tyko</a>. “Consider whether or not these boots can complement or suit daily outfits.” This holds especially true if you’re not planning to swap out your shoes once you arrive at your destination. “For outdoor purposes such as hiking, I’d reserve a separate pair for occasional use. Trying to use the same pair for both might result in premature wear, affecting their performance during hikes.”</li><li><strong>Water-Resistant vs. Waterproof: </strong>What’s more, the purpose may determine whether you truly need a fully waterproof boot or can get away with something that’s just water-resistant. “If you’re purchasing a pair for hiking or you live in a climate with consistent rain, you’ll need something waterproof,” says Next Level Wardrobe styling manager and stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Maggie Martens</a>. “If the purpose of your new boots is for general day-to-day use for errands and such, you can more likely get away with a water-resistant style.”</li><li><strong>Material: </strong>The materials a boot is constructed with (and what treatments those materials are given) are integral to ensuring it’s waterproof and not just water-resistant. “Waterproof textiles act as an impenetrable shield against water, blocking it entirely even during heavy rain or submersion; conversely, water-resistant textiles provide a degree of protection against water but may yield to heavy or prolonged exposure, allowing water to seep through over time,” explains textile and fashion designer and Litchi World co-founder <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="nofollow nocaes">Isabelle Abbott</a>. Waterproof leather and suede are great choices and often less technical-looking, so long as they’re actually waterproof (more on that below). Boots billed as water-resistant may be more breathable, with certain elements that will keep water out but with less of a guarantee depending on the environment.</li><li><strong>Construction:</strong> So, what to look for? “Visually, the easiest waterproof boots to spot are those made totally from rubber or those that have a rubber shell around the foot with the shaft (the leg of the boot) made from leather or textile,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Ann Williams</a>, a footwear designer and Schwartz's co-founding partner. It’s often a combination of elements, rather than any one treatment, that makes a boot waterproof versus merely water-resistant. “For instance, a boot may feature a waterproof membrane like Gore-Tex or a particular brand’s proprietary technology paired with materials that have been treated in some way, like with a DWR (a durable water repellent finish).” Nylon and polyester are common fabrics treated with DWR coatings, adds Abbott, which creates a surface that causes the water to bead up and roll off. Textiles aside, other construction features affect how successful a boot will be in keeping water out, adds Schwartz. “These can include such as sealed or taped seams, bellows tongues, snug-fitting toplines — or even better, gator or drawstring toplines, rubber toe caps, and/or foxings that are integrated into the midsole of the boots. The bottom line is that you want to pick a style with the fewest places where water can enter the boot and get to the foot.”</li><li><strong>Traction and Grip: </strong>If you’re trudging through wet terrains, mountaineer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=6 rel=nocaes>Amira Patel</a> recommends looking for styles that offer great traction and grip to prevent slipping. “Opt for boots with a sturdy outsole featuring deep lugs or aggressive treads, which will provide excellent traction on various surfaces, preventing slips and falls,” she says. “Consider boots with a Vibram sole, known for its durability and exceptional grip on both dry and wet terrain — and if you’ll be encountering snow, you’ll need boots that can easily be used with crampons [traction devices used for walking on firm snow and ice]."</li><li><strong>Breathability:</strong> The breathability of any materials and treatments used is another key factor to consider, especially if you’ll be wearing your boots for long periods of time, says Williams. “If these products aren’t breathable, the foot might be protected from getting wet by outside factors but might still feel damp due to the wearer’s foot being sweaty and clammy.” Hiking boots are more commonly made with breathable textiles, while classic rubber rain boots tend to be less breathable. However, boots that feature sweat-wicking linings can help combat this issue.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is leather waterproof?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Many waterproof boots are made with leather and suede, but not all leather is waterproof. “Leather isn’t inherently waterproof, but boots labeled as ‘waterproof leather’ have undergone treatments to enhance their water resistance,” explains Abbott. “This treatment involves <strong>applying specific agents or coatings</strong> to the leather, making it more effective in repelling water than untreated leather.” That said, we wouldn’t recommend relying on your usual leather ankle booties to keep you dry in a monsoon; plus, you run the risk of ruining them.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you care for waterproof boots?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">How you’ll need to care for your waterproof boots will vary from style to style. “Always <strong>follow the manufacturer’s instructions</strong> carefully, as they should be written for the particular boot and particular materials used,” says Schwartz. “<strong>Care for materials may vary</strong> between products, brands, and applications, but as with any type of footwear, be sure to air dry wet boots in a well-ventilated space away from direct heat. Once completely dry, you can then remove mud and other debris with a soft bristle shoe brush or by knocking the boots together.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you style waterproof boots?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are endless ways to style waterproof boots, but you’ll first want to consider the style of boot. <strong>Outdoorsy hiking styles</strong> fall into the still very-much-relevant gorpcore trend, meaning you don’t have to just wear them to go on an actual hike. “The same way non-skaters wear skating shoes or non-athletes pair leggings or bike shorts with their everyday staples, hiking boots could easily be incorporated into your existing wardrobe — as long as they’re comfortable,” says Tyko. However, Martens recommends that non-hikers consider their lifestyle when selecting a pair. “Do you work from home or have a casual office dress code? You can likely go all-in on the trend and opt for a sportier style; on the other hand, if you work in a business casual or formal setting, it’ll be more difficult to incorporate them into your day-to-day closet and will likely be reserved for weekend wear,” she says. That, or be sure to bring a change of footwear with you to the office.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But what about your classic rain boot? “Traditional rubber styles will always say ‘rain boot’ and draw attention away from the rest of your outfit, so if you plan on having them be a part of your all-day outfit, opt for a neutral pair with a matte finish,” says Martens. “I recommend a dark color like <strong>black or chocolate brown for maximum versatility and easier outfitting</strong>.” Ankle-height Chelsea styles are perhaps the easiest to work into your typical day-to-day wardrobe since they look similar to classic leather Chelsea boots, especially in dark colors. In this case, Tyko recommends styling them as you would a regular boot — she suggests with a midi high-waisted denim skirt and a tee, or cuffed straight jeans and hoodie with an oversized coat or jacket.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can you wear classic rain boots to hike?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It really depends. “Rubber rain boots are typically designed for wet conditions, with their waterproof nature protecting hikers from moisture and mud,” explains Patel. “This can be advantageous during hikes where encountering streams or wet terrains is likely; however, they typically lack the specialized cushioning and support that hiking boots offer, which can lead to discomfort or foot fatigue during long hikes or uneven terrain, or even blisters and changing due to their limited breathability. That said, hikers must <strong>consider the limitations of rubber rain boots</strong>, and it’s essential to <strong>assess terrain, weather, and duration</strong> of the hike before making a decision.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jenna Igneri</a> is a freelance writer who has been working in fashion and beauty media for over a decade. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Katherine J.
