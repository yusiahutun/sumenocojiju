It all started with her Insta post on&nbsp;29th May after&nbsp;she shared a titillating picture of her in a schoolgirl outfit.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Interestingly, the rapper&nbsp;was quick to comment on her picture with three emojis, and&nbsp;Nikki&nbsp;replied with a shy emoji as well. So, as evident, it&nbsp;triggered rumors that the two were seeing each other and the possibility&nbsp;remained that the rapper was her new boyfriend. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Ex-Girlfriend Of 50 Cent :-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Vivica A.

Her bombshell body didn't come naturally, although many might assume it from the first look.
