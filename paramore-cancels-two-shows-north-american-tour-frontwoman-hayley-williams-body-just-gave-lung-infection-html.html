Frontwoman Hayley Williams, 34, has been trying to soldier on with a lung infection, which forced the This Is Why group to postpone four shows after the 34-year-old singer’s body 'just gave out' after she initially tried to battle through.
However, after completing two of the rescheduled concerts in San Francisco on Monday, August 7, and Seattle on Wednesday, August 9 — which Williams said 'got a little scary,' the band was forced to pull the plug on its shows at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Portland tonight (August 10) and the Delta Center in Salt Lake City on Sunday, August 13."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>
