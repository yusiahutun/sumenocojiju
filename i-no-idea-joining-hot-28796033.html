Well, that’s exactly what Sophie Stonehouse, 22, realised when she found out she was actually on the fourth season of Too Hot to Handle (THTH).
The show sees a group of determined singles meeting, mingling, and remaining celibate for their chance to win $100,000 – and hopefully, find a genuine connection."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I was very shocked, to say the least!”</p><p>Sophie was scouted via Instagram to apply for what casting agents pretended Wild Love.</p><p>The message mentioned that the show would be "filmed abroad in an exotic location" and the contestant was sceptical upon receiving the message.</p><p>She didn’t reply straight away – but once she realised that there were other reality stars following the casting account, it gave her the indication that it was legitimate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>“The hardest part of the competition for many is trying to resist any temptation to be physical as this results in money being taken away from the cash prize,” she said.</p><p>“I think in any circumstance when you’re getting to know someone, there are always thoughts about getting physical.</p><p>“However, we were constantly reminded by Lana to deepen connections without being physical with one another.</p><p>“Don’t get me wrong, it was hard at times and I definitely was up for breaking rules! I truly did put my all into the experience and did my best to follow Lana’s advice.</p><p>“There were mixed emotions when other people broke rules.</p><p>"Ultimately I was very happy for people to sacrifice money if they were building a genuine connection.

As I said previously, I wanted to deal with this behind close doors and not ruin anyone else’s time in the retreat,” she explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28796110.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_n1JPG.jpg><p>“I didn’t want new couples to stop getting to know one another because of my own feelings. I think that in itself is a tough thing to do! I made it very clear that I wanted to go home.</p><p>“It got to a point where I was not being kind to myself by staying. I was relieved to be sent home, as the situation proved I wasn’t ready to be in a relationship and I also was desperate for a cuddle with my mum!”</p><p>All of this being said, she wouldn’t change anything for the world.</p><p>“It was an experience that I will never forget and I’m extremely grateful. I’ve never been in such a beautiful place in my whole life and I truly felt like I had won the lottery, getting an experience like that,” she told us.</p><p>“I am actually very proud of the way I reacted to what happened in the retreat. My natural instinct would have been to act differently to how I behaved.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28796113.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_n11JPG.jpg><p>“But actually the environment itself allowed me to take time for myself, and reflect on my own feelings in private during confessionals.</p><p>“I was very adamant to not ruin anyone else’s experiences, despite my hurt and upset and I learnt a lot about myself in doing this. I wouldn’t change a thing!”</p><p>If there’s anything she wants people to take away from the show, it’s that to treat people with kindness.</p><p>She added: “Despite what anyone has seen on the show, I would love for everyone to remember to be kind to one another</p><p>“At the end of the day everyone makes mistakes, especially boys, as all of you ladies know, but if I can forgive them so can you!”</p><p><b>READ NEXT:</b></p><ul><li><span><b><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>Meet female electricians bossing industry – despite being judged over good looks</a></b></span></li><li><span><b><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>‘Sex work is the hardest job I’ve ever done – but I love working for Babestation’</a></b></span></li><li><span><b><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>'I'm called real-life Rapunzel and my locks attract men – but it's a lot of work'</a></b></span></li><li><b><i>For more lifestyle stories, <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section>sign up to the free Hot Topics newsletter here.</a></i></b></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=28740321><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|Image aria-label="Man crowned world's shortest person stands at 2ft tall and 'loves the attention'" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=28740321><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28796116.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_n10JPG.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28740367.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_The-shortest-living-man-is-Afshin-Ghaderzadeh.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=28740321>Man crowned world's shortest person stands at 2ft tall and 'loves the attention'</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=28738778><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|Image aria-label="‘I went from banking to being a bimbo – I love expressing my sexuality’" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=28738778><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28796120.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_n5JPG.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28738796.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_INSTAGRAM.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=28738778>‘I went from banking to being a bimbo – I love expressing my sexuality’</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZLZuus5moJ2dkWK3sLXNoqWgZZikwW5%2Bl3Bwb2hjaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
