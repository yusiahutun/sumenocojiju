Plus Delicious Recipes to Enjoy</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-06-21</div><p>Since eggnog is the quintessential Christmas drink, we’re here to address some common questions around the popular drink. A good place to start: What does eggnog taste like? Well, this drink is rich, sweet and creamy, with the perfect hint of warming spices. It’s delicious enjoyed on its own or mixed in a festive cocktail — you can even use it in baked goods to fill them with the flavors of the season. Ready to get into the holiday spirit? Keep scrolling for everything you need to know about eggnog, from easy homemade recipes to how to use it in French toast and more!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is eggnog?</h2><p>Eggnog contains a mixture of eggs, heavy cream, milk, spices, sugar and, sometimes, liquor like brandy, rum or bourbon. This mixture can either be simmered until it reaches about 160°F and then cooled, or it’s simply blended to fully combine the ingredients.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The history of eggnog</h2><p>Though it’s long been a holiday staple, eggnog was reportedly born out of an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">egg custard drink from medieval Britain</a> called posset. The drink was mainly consumed by wealthy individuals as ingredients like eggs, sugar and cream were pricey during that time. Things changed in the mid-1700s — that’s when the drink made its way to North America and become known as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“egg-n-grog”</a>, and eventually the name was simplified to eggnog. It didn’t take long for this drink to establish itself as Christmas favorite since it could be served warm to beat the winter chill. Although classic eggnog is beloved by many, options like <a href=#>dairy-free oat nog</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">low-carb keto eggnog</a> are gaining popularity as alternative ways to savor this seasonal treat.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The versatility of eggnog</h2><p>Sipping a glass of eggnog is a surefire way to get into the festive spirit. But, for other ways to use up the remaining amount, try these suggestions for cooking or making drinks with it.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Cooking with eggnog</h3><p>Eggnog’s thick texture makes it a great dairy swap for various sweet treats. “When using eggnog in baking, it can be substituted for milk or cream in recipes such as pound cake, cheesecake, cinnamon rolls and pancakes,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Norah Clark</a>, pastry chef and food editor at&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Boyd Hampers</a>, says. You can replace the full amount or half of the regular dairy with eggnog in your desired recipe.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Making cocktails with eggnog</h3><p>Adding eggnog to a cocktail base gives the final drink a buttery lusciousness and complements the flavors of certain alcohols. “Choosing an alcohol with its own notes of sweetness is a good rule of thumb,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Maggie Turansky</a>, founder and head recipe developer at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">No Frills Kitchen</a>, says. “Personally, I think that eggnog works best with brandy or bourbon, but rum is also a popular option.” One great alcohol pairing for eggnog is Saint Cloud’s Single Barrel 100 Proof Bourbon (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Available at SaintCloudBourbon.com</a>) as the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">notes of vanilla and chocolate</a> perfectly balance the drink’s richness.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to make eggnog</h2><p>Although eggnog is available in stores, preparing it yourself allows you to adjust the measurements to make it as sweet, spiced or creamy as you’d like. Below, Clark shares her simple no-cook recipe — which preps in under 15 minutes and tastes like the real deal!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Homemade Eggnog</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Two-Glasses-of-Eggnog.jpg><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>4 large pasteurized eggs</li><li>¾ cup granulated sugar</li><li>½ tsp. ground cinnamon</li><li>¼ tsp. ground nutmeg</li><li>¼ tsp. ground cloves</li><li>¾ cup brandy, or a mixture of ½ brandy + ½ bourbon</li><li>1½ cup whole milk</li><li>1 cup heavy cream</li></ul><p><strong>Directions:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Yield: </strong>approximately 4 to 6 servings</li></ul><li>Add eggs to blender and blend on medium speed 30 seconds. With blender running, slowly add sugar and blend additional 20 seconds.</li><li>Add nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, brandy, milk and heavy cream. Blend until combined.</li><li>Transfer to airtight container and cover. Store in refrigerator until ready to use within 1 week.</li><li>Stir before serving and add sprinkle of ground nutmeg on top.<p><strong>Note:</strong> According to the experts at the University of Minnesota<strong> </strong>Extension, pasteurized eggs are best to use for uncooked eggnog as they’ve <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">already been heated and don’t require further cooking</a>. This also reduces the risk of ingesting <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">foodborne illness-causing bacteria</a>.</p></li><p>Bonus: To make a cooked version of this drink, check out this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">5-Ingredient Classic Eggnog recipe</a> from the American Egg Board.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Can you freeze eggnog?</h2><p>Whether store-bought or homemade, you can pour eggnog into an airtight container and store it in the freezer for up to 6 months. While this allows you to enjoy well past Christmas, freezing the drink may cause it to separate and lose its velvety texture. So, for best results, chef <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nelson Serrano-Bahri</a>, director of innovation at the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Egg Board</a>, suggests refrigerating homemade eggnog for around 3 days and store-bought varieties for up to 1 week. “Commercially prepared eggnog or homemade eggnog should not be left out at room temperature for more than 2 hours,” he adds. Ultimately, storing eggnog correctly maintains its signature flavor and texture so it’s delicious with every sip.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3 delicious recipes that use eggnog</h2><p>To cook, drink and bake with eggnog during the festive season and beyond, whip up these tasty recipes from our test kitchen!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Eggnog French Toast</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Eggnog-French-Toast.jpg><p>Using eggnog in place of milk gives this breakfast an extra-rich spin.</p><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>4 eggs</li><li>1 cup eggnog</li><li>1 tsp. rum extract</li><li>½&nbsp;tsp. ground cinnamon</li><li>12 slices bread</li><li>1 Tbs. butter</li></ul><p><strong>Directions:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Yield:</strong> 6 servings</li></ul><li>Mix 4 eggs, 1 cup eggnog, 1 tsp. rum extract and&nbsp;½&nbsp;tsp. ground cinnamon.
