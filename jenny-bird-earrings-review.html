I can usually bite my tongue before blurting out, "Where did you get that?!" Copy and pasting another person's look is the antithesis of personal style, after all. But I'm grateful I made an exception for a pair of especially shiny hoops I noticed two Bazaar fashion editors wearing this fall.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The hoops that hypnotized me were <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://jenny-bird.com/products/tome-hoops-small-gold data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jenny Bird's Tome hoop" data-vars-ga-product-id=70e04138-e72a-404c-a97b-07d42d1e9a78 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://jenny-bird.com/products/tome-hoops-small-gold data-product-url=https://jenny-bird.com/products/tome-hoops-small-gold data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fjenny-bird.com%2Fproducts%2Ftome-hoops-small-gold" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$110.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=922753c8-9097-4a17-8fc8-cbbe10b9b712 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Jenny Bird's Tome hoop</a>—a bubbly style that comes in silver and gold with a rounded stud backing.

"They've practically become an extension of my ear," she told me over Slack. "I’m never not wearing these earrings. They’re the perfect weight, shine, and size."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bazaar staffers aren't the first to become infatuated with Canadian designer Jenny Bird's hoop earrings. They're a daily staple among celebrities—in a moment of fashion diplomacy or just shared taste, both Hailey Bieber and Selena Gomez started their earring stacks with the label's <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://jenny-bird.com/products/chunky-doune-hoops-gold?nosto=landing-nosto-10" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Doune hoops" data-vars-ga-product-id=a550e0fa-106b-45b3-b68e-1cb92d04ea1e data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href="https://jenny-bird.com/products/chunky-doune-hoops-gold?nosto=landing-nosto-10" data-product-url="https://jenny-bird.com/products/chunky-doune-hoops-gold?nosto=landing-nosto-10" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fjenny-bird.com%2Fproducts%2Fchunky-doune-hoops-gold%3Fnosto%3Dlanding-nosto-10" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=91d54378-e42f-49cb-ade2-5ac1235f7eb7 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Doune hoops</a> on multiple occasions this year. But it's the hollowed-out Tome model that's gained a word-of-mouth, offline following among fashion editors. "It’s an all-star in our essential earring offering," Jenny Bird (the designer) told me. "The voluminous tubular hoop is now a mainstay and since we offer it in three sizes, we’ve become the destination for them."</p><img alt="bazaar editor jaclyn cohen walks down the street wearing jenny bird hoops in a editors review of jenny bird hoops" title="Jenny Bird Hoops Review 2024" width=1170 height=1455 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-9182-6580ade87be48.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Getty / Daniel Edward</span></p><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">Jenny Bird Tome Hoops</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$110 at jenny-bird.com for Tome Hoops" data-href=https://jenny-bird.com/products/tome-hoops-small-silver data-product-url=https://jenny-bird.com/products/tome-hoops-small-silver data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fjenny-bird.com%2Fproducts%2Ftome-hoops-small-silver" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$110 at jenny-bird.com" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://jenny-bird.com/products/tome-hoops-small-silver data-vars-ga-product-brand="Jenny Bird" data-vars-ga-product-id=33e76786-1c80-4942-9f91-0703ec49732c data-vars-ga-product-price=$110.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=af5d6f34-34d3-442f-8fb6-7813a9cda8f5 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="BEST SELLER" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=tome-hoops-small-silver data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Tome Hoops" title="Tome Hoops" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1702920429-TomeHoopsSmallEarrings-Silver-1.jpg width=1400 height=1750 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">Jenny Bird Tome Hoops</h2></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I ended up going for a small, silver pair to get the same balloon shape without outright copying my colleagues. They're a compliment to my new second and third piercings—where I'm still wearing my piercing shop-issued diamond studs. It didn't take long to understand just why my coworkers aren't switching out their hoops often: In addition to having a shine unrivaled by other earrings at a similar price point, their hollow form also makes them nearly feather-light. I'm usually a stickler about taking my earrings out at night, but I've spent more than a few evenings blissfully falling asleep with these in.</p><img alt="a woman wearing sunglasses" title="Jenny Bird Hoop Earring Review 2024" width=2316 height=3088 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-4063-6581e02606c5d.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy Jaclyn Alexandra Cohen</span><p>Senior fashion editor Jaclyn Alexandra Cohen wears her Jenny Bird Tome hoops with a white T-shirt and gold-tone jewelry...</p><img alt="a fashion editor wears a pair of metal rimmed glasses and a turtleneck to illustrate a review of jenny bird hoop earrings" title="Jenny Bird Hoop Earrings 2024" width=2316 height=3088 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-1953-jpg-6581e05a0ab54.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy Halie LeSavage</span><p>...while fashion commerce editor Halie LeSavage wears her silver Tome hoops with coordinating jewelry and neutral knitwear.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Tome hoop doesn't have to be limited to one location if you have multiple piercings, or even one type of outfit. "The small Tome hoops look amazing in a second hole piercing with another statement earring below it," Bird said. "They make a great everyday hoop on their own, too."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When you love something, you want to wear it constantly—and maybe, you hope for people to ask where you found the piece you're so obsessed with. As it turns out, I'm hardly the first person to ask who's responsible for these perfect hoops. "I couldn’t gatekeep these if I tried—friends, family, even strangers at my bodega in Soho have stopped me to get ahold of where they can get these earrings," Cohen said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A few days after our conversation, I wore my silver hoops to meet a coworker I hadn't seen in weeks. Like clockwork, she immediately asked where I found my earrings.
