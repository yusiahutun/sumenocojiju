However, the actress revealed that the two decided early on not to turn their onscreen romance into a real-life relationship. “We would have ruined [it] if we had taken that extra step. We thought about it, but we didn’t,” she explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/michael-learned-ralph-waite.jpg><p>Outside of work, Michael faced several personal hardships that Ralph ultimately helped her though. “Oddly though, my personal life wasn’t quite as smooth as my TV life. There were times when I would be sitting on the set wishing I always had a happy ending, too,” she told Closer.&nbsp;At the time The Waltons premiered, Michael leaned on her costar during her divorce from her first husband, Canadian actor <strong>Peter Donat</strong>. “I was going through a divorce and I was drinking because I was sad and depressed,” she said.</p><p>“I wasn’t hiding bottles [but] we’d go out and have lunch and drink wine and then go back on the set a little bit tipsy,” Michael recalled. “Ralph was the one who said, ‘You have a problem.’ And I said, ‘No, I don’t. I can stop,’ which I could.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/the-waltons.jpg><p>After her divorce was finalized in 1972, Michael could have entered into a romance with Ralph but the two always chose to keep things professional. “There was a period where Ralph and I were both single and we did love each other. We thought maybe we should give it a whirl,” the actress explained. “So I drove up to Malibu [to see him] but when I got there we just looked at each other and thought, ‘Nah, this will never work.’ We were smart enough not to carry it to the next step because I think it could have gotten really messy.”</p><p>“After that, all our lovemaking was onscreen. We became spiritual husband and wife. I think it was a good thing because onset romances can turn nasty … but our love was very deep and very true,” Michael added.</p><p class=p1>For more on Michael, Ralph and The Waltons, pick up the latest issue of Closer Weekly, on newsstands now — and be sure to[<a href=#>sign up for our newsletter</a> for more exclusive news!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/closer-cover.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46moJygkZq5brjEmqmnnZRiwaK4yqxkn6qZmrulv8eip2avmam1bq%2FOrKuaql2nrq28x2aumqGkmnqmxMKlrKyhppp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
