It’s been a year and a half since Her late Majesty left us. Queen Elizabeth II‘s death coincided with the beginning of her son King Charles‘ reign.

However, the drama among royals in the hours following the queen’s passing is still making news. Royal biographer Robert Hardman’s new book has shot down previous claims suggesting that the King had asked <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> not to come to Balmoral after the queen’s passing so <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> could be cut out too.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1198421581-1024x755.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-claims-that-meghan-is-not-being-called-to-balmoral>Prince Harry claims that Meghan is not being called to Balmoral</h2><p>In his 2023 biography Spare, <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> claimed that, following the Queen’s death, he received a call from King Charles. The monarch reportedly told Harry that he was welcome at Balmoral but Meghan was not. The King allegedly didn’t want many people around.</p><p>“No other wives were coming, Kate wasn’t coming, he said, therefore Meg shouldn’t,” the text in Spare states.</p><p>Hence Prince Harry took a plane to Balmoral in Scotland by himself while Meghan joined him later. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were already in Europe at the time of the Queen’s death as they were set to make an appearance at the WellChild Awards in London.</p><p>Previously royal author Robert Jobson had claimed that King Charles asked Kate not to come so that Meghan wouldn’t come either. Speaking to the&nbsp;Daily Telegraph Australia, Jobson <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>: “If Catherine doesn’t come, Meghan can’t either, it’s not appropriate for wives to attend.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1243112535-1024x683.jpg><p>“Privately, he wanted to say Meghan was not welcome but he couldn’t say that to Harry so he intervened and asked Kate to stay back so that it was fairer on Meghan,” the biographer claimed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-new-claim-says-kate-chose-to-stay-with-kids-after-queen-s-death>New claim says Kate chose to stay with kids after Queen’s death</h2><p>Fresh claims in biographer Robert Hardman’s book Charles III: New King. New Court. The Inside Story reveals that Kate chose to stay back with her kids and wasn’t ordered to do so.</p><p>“That was a conscious decision that she made for her and her family,” royal commentator Kinsey Schofield <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> GB News recently.</p><p>The commentator said, “While Catherine stayed back to support her babies, Meghan was thousands of miles away from hers in the UK to accept another participation trophy.”</p><p>An excerpt from Hardman’s book, published in the Daily Mail, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">notes</a> that Kate chose to stay put at Adelaide cottage with Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis. The three were starting at their new school, Lambrook, on the day of the Queen’s passing and the Princess of Wales felt they needed one parent with them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-william-kate-meghan-and-harry-s-walkabout-was-uncomfortable>William, Kate, Meghan and Harry’s walkabout was ‘uncomfortable’</h2><p>Royal biographer Robert Hardman has also said (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">per</a> the Mirror) that Prince William was the one who suggested and organized his, Kate’s, Prince Harry‘s, and Meghan’s public Windsor walkabout after the queen’s death.</p><p>The four stepped out of a car that William was driving. A member of the Wales’s team reportedly said that neither of the four found it easy.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2aDcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GaapZmZoravs4ykmK2dXayutHnUrJydZaSkeqyxxKlkpp2Xna6vecCwmLJlo528tXnDqK6nZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
