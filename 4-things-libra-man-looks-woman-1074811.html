The foundation is formed by being on the same wavelength in terms of preoccupations. His tastes are polished. A Libra man prefers a lady who is considerate and elegant. She should be as sociable and outgoing as he is, and she should communicate in an open and honest manner.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Here we bring you 4 traits that a Libra man is looking for in a woman of his choice.</p><p><img alt title width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/libra-pair-attractive.jpg></p><p dir=ltr><strong>1. He wants the pair to look good together</strong></p><p dir=ltr>A Libra guy is drawn to a mate who compliments him in all aspects, including appearance. To put it another way, you must look nice together. He admires women who are well-dressed, healthy, sophisticated, intelligent, socially curious, and fair-minded. Above all, honesty will win his affection.</p><p><img alt title width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/partner-fun-loving.jpg></p><p dir=ltr><strong>2. Partner should be fun-loving</strong></p><p dir=ltr>Libra men are incredibly charming and flirtatious; they require women who can have fun, be playful, and flirt right back. Libras show their love with charming, captivating features that make them the men of our fantasies! All we need is a sense of humour to appreciate this aspect of them!</p><p dir=ltr><strong>3. He can’t handle too much confrontation</strong></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p dir=ltr>Don't stoop to a gossipy or lowbrow attitude if you want to win the Libra man. He can't tolerate a lot of conflicts and may be irritated by a strong-willed companion. He's not very direct because there's always a pause in between as he assesses a scenario. He'll become irritable if he's thrown off balance too much by an impatient date. He seeks intimacy but requires mental space to do his thing before acting.</p><p><img alt title width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/intelligent-libra-man-attract.jpg></p><p dir=ltr><strong>4. The woman should be intelligent</strong></p><p dir=ltr>A Libra man seeks a woman with whom he can have engaging chats. She should be knowledgeable and interested in a wide range of topics, and she should like staying up late conversing with him. He isn't impressed by a shallow woman or someone who claims to be less intelligent than she is. If you want to win the heart of a Libra man, don't be scared to show off your intelligence and wit.</p><p dir=ltr>Libras like love and many people born under this sign find it. It's a beautiful match of extraordinary twosome synchronicity if a Libra man enjoys his reflection in you and sees space for growth.</p><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","4 Things a Libra man looks for in a woman",1074811,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/people/4-ways-woo-aquarius-woman-1074095","articlepage","/lifestyle/people/4-things-libra-man-looks-woman-1074811","Content Also read","lifestyle","people"),triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","4 Things a Libra man looks for in a woman",1074811,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/people/4-ways-woo-aquarius-woman-1074095","articlepage","/lifestyle/people/4-things-libra-man-looks-woman-1074811","4 Ways to woo an Aquarius woman","Also_Read","lifestyle","people")'><strong>4 Ways to woo an Aquarius woman</strong></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGijop6VqMG6uMRop56noKGycICMrZ%2Bippeoeq21wauYZqWRo3qtu86kqmavn6Kur3mQaW5tcGFm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
