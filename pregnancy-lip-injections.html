And the internet is one hell of a judgmental place. This week, scattered between stories of how basically being a woman is now considered a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a9605581/ahca-vote/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="pre-existing condition" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">pre-existing condition</a> in this country, lived several <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://elitedaily.com/entertainment/celebrity/beyonce-lip-injections-rumors/1832999/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="gossip-y stories" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">gossip-y stories</a> about how Beyoncé "probably" had lip injections while pregnant with twins. This is utter nonsense. Do we really have to explain the biology of pregnancy to the world? I guess so.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"What do you know about the effects of pregnancy on a woman's entire body? Please tell me," the singer's representative, Yvette Noel-Schure, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.gossipcop.com/beyonce-rep-slams-mediatakeout-false-lip-injections-claim-statement-yvette-noel-schure/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said in response" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">said in response</a> to a story on the site MediaTakeOut. "Did you know that in addition to weight gain there is often a dramatic change in the blood flow in the system and increased fluid causing swelling? Do you know that often women's gums get swollen? Do you know that it sometimes affects our speech, our ability to chew intently and a host of other things?"<span></span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Edema—or excess swelling—is a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://americanpregnancy.org/pregnancy-health/swelling-during-pregnancy/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="very common" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">very common</a> side-effect of pregnancy, since the body is working overtime to double its blood and body fluid to support the developing baby. "It is common for women to retain fluid during pregnancy, which can cause swelling of the legs and even the face," Dr. Joshua Zeichner, director of cosmetic and clinical research at Mount Sinai's Department of Dermatology in New York, told BAZAAR.com. Think of it this way: don't your lips feel chapped, dry, and painfully swollen when you're thirsty? Imagine what they'd look like if your entire body was a factory of excess fluid and swelling. Just because plumped lips are a feature we find cosmetically beautiful doesn't mean they were achieved by an elective choice.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The sacrifice to our faces, our feet and our entire bodies is something we welcome because we bring beautiful humans into the world who will one day combat your hate and negativity," Noel-Schure added. "I stood silent during Beyonce's first pregnancy when you thought it was okay to bully her like the cowards you are, when you accused her of never being pregnant, but I simply cannot this time."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This isn't the first time that the internet has accused a pregnant woman of injections. Kim Kardashian faced similar backlash during her two pregnancies, with many fans <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-beauty/news/kim-kardashians-pregnancy-lips--real-or-plastic-surgery-2015268 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="accusing her" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">accusing her</a> of getting "Botox" (which, for the record, is absolutely not what you put into lips to plump them) or dermal filler. "No I don't do fillers or botox when pregnant like some tabloids are reporting, you would have to be really sick to endanger your child like that," Kardashian previously wrote on Instagram. "Anyone who has been pregnant or gained weight knows your face totally changes! My nose gets bigger, cheeks fuller & my lips swell up."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Plump lips are a normal, natural reaction. When we accuse women of getting cosmetic procedures during pregnancy—what exactly are we trying to achieve? Are we trying to catch them, god forbid, caring about how they look? And if a woman did admit to them, why should we care? It's her body, her child, her choice. It's not illegal for pregnant women to get Botox or dermal fillers; if they found a willing injector, they absolutely could get something done. "Dermal fillers haven't been tested on pregnant patients so there isn't concrete medical evidence to support safety of fillers during pregnancy," Dr. Melissa Kanchanapoomi Levin, board certified dermatologist in NYC and clinical Instructor at Mount Sinai, told BAZAAR.com. "Fillers like Restylane and Juvederm are made from hyaluronic acid which is natural sugar molecule. While the human body produces hyaluronic acid naturally, since it is not FDA approved and there are no definitive studies, it is best to avoid until after the pregnancy." So getting lip fillers during pregnancy is not necessarily the smartest or safest choice, but it's not our choice to make.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We have no business policing what a pregnant woman does to her body. What she eats or doesn't eat, what tests she gets done, what crib she buys, and what she does or doesn't do to her face is not up for discussion. So do us all a favor: the next time you feel like releasing a snarky comment or opinion about how a pregnant woman looks to you—just don't.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a5b794e4-ba0e-4527-9e9d-e98142b9fbef_1526586861.jpg alt="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" title="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jenna Rosenstein is the Beauty Director at Harper's BAZAAR across both print and digital. While attending NYU, she held internships at Women’s Wear Daily, Bloomingdale’s, Harper’s BAZAAR, and Allure, the latter of which she parlayed into her first job as the Beauty Assistant. She left Allure three years later as the Senior Beauty Editor. She spent a few months at Refinery29 overseeing branded content in the same title, before finally landing back at BAZAAR to manage all beauty content. When she's not testing every lipstick known to mankind, getting zapped by new lasers, or interviewing experts and celebrities, you can find Rosenstein at home in New Jersey with her son, husband, and black cat named Maddie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqGdkaHBqXvAcm1pcWNlgHC80Z6ep5memMZuuMipZKKmmpqwtbXOp6po</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
