It can also mean dove, but she told me adamantly that it was paloma for pigeon, absolutely not dove. My cousins’ nicknames are the Spanish words for princess, prince, and king, but I’m just a pigeon in a sea of royalty. Although, I guess one could argue pigeons are like New York royalty. Some might even say it’s their kingdom we’re living in.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But that’s not why she calls me paloma, and it’s not because she hates me either. Pigeons are simply her favorite animal, and when she was lonely after immigrating to New York City, she found respite from feeding the pigeons in Astoria Park. “I feel bad because nobody loves them,” she’d always tell me. And when I told her about <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.jwanderson.com/us/shopping/pigeon-clutch-bag-18382592? data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="JW Anderson’s $890 pigeon bag" data-vars-ga-product-id=c70bce8f-fa61-412d-815c-2428c7064737 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.jwanderson.com/us/shopping/pigeon-clutch-bag-18382592? data-product-url=https://www.jwanderson.com/us/shopping/pigeon-clutch-bag-18382592? data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jwanderson.com%2Fus%2Fshopping%2Fpigeon-clutch-bag-18382592%3F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$890.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=3894da39-08d0-4d08-a46e-004038a48f54 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category=Clutches class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090"><u>JW Anderson’s $890 pigeon bag</u></a>, she said, “Good for them!” The bag is currently sold out (although you can preorder it now for next February), and I’ve never been prouder of my nickname, or more confident in my abuela’s ability to prophesize trends. Has Jonathan Anderson somehow shifted the narrative around pigeons with his controversial clutch, or is everyone else just now seeing the beauty in the rats of the sky?</p><img alt="jw anderson runway look featuring the pigeon clutch" title="jw anderson runway look featuring the pigeon clutch" width=1600 height=2400 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jwa-maw22-look-38-1666068806.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of JW Anderson</span><p>A model double fisting JW Anderson pigeon clutches at the men’s fall 2022 show.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Carrie Bradshaw definitely does. While filming the second season of And Just Like That…, Sarah Jessica Parker was spotted on set holding the pigeon clutch. Within minutes, people online were reminiscing about the moment in Season 2 of Sex and the City when Mr. Big gave Carrie a bedazzled Judith Leiber swan bag instead of just saying, “I love you.” The bag was considered horrible at the time both by viewers and by Carrie, who says in her voice-over, “It was just … wrong,” not once but twice after opening it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But I couldn’t help but wonder, Was the very thing that felt so wrong about the Judith Leiber swan bag exactly what felt so right about the JW Anderson pigeon bag? With no gems or frills, the 3D-printed clutch presents pigeons exactly as they are. That might also be why people are so bemused by its existence.<br></p><img alt="new york, new york october 05 sarah jessica parker is seen on the set of and just like that season 2 the follow up series to sex and the city on october 05, 2022 in new york city photo by james devaneygc images" title="Celebrity Sightings In New York City - October 05, 2022" width=2913 height=3134 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1666068979.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">James Devaney</span><p>Sarah Jessica Parker looking particularly joyful while holding the JW Anderson pigeon clutch while filming the second season of And Just Like That.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jonathan Anderson originally showed the pigeon as part of his men’s fall 2022 collection in the middle of omicron, because like the rest of us, he desperately needed a laugh. “I wanted an element of something a bit silly in the collection, a contrast to the situation at the time,” he tells BAZAAR in an interview. “Fashion has this great way of allowing us to escape reality. Also pigeons are so inherently unglamorous, it’s funny to turn it into a functional object like a clutch bag that’s typically seen as quite glamorous.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The response was so massive, he decided to produce it. “Pigeons are such a funny symbol in the landscape of metropolitan life, something that’s so easily recognized and relatable for citizens in nearly every city in the world,” he adds. “They really are the most successful bird!” The bag is currently one of the most researched and viewed product pages on the brand’s website, where traffic has nearly tripled since Parker was seen carrying it.</p><img alt="new york, ny october 06 sarah jessica parker is seen on the set of and just like that on october 06, 2022 in new york city photo by jose perezbauer griffingc images" title="Celebrity Sightings In New York - October 06, 2022" width=2576 height=3510 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1666069406.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jose Perez/Bauer-Griffin</span><p>Carrie Bradshaw perusing a store while proudly holding her JW Anderson pigeon bag.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Typically, a designer bag is an indicator of wealth and status. To the untrained eye, though, JW Anderson’s pigeon clutch doesn’t present as a $890 luxury good. And yet, it feels more in line with what today’s younger generation wants from their clothing: something weird and untrendy that sets them apart. It’s also—like all the very best fashion should be—an instant conversation starter, even among those who would claim to not know the first thing about fashion.</p><img alt="jenny walton with a jw anderson pigeon clutch at a dinner in milan" title="jenny walton with a jw anderson pigeon clutch at a dinner in milan" width=3024 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-5567-1666069094.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Jenny Walton</span><p>Jenny Walton also looking particularly joyful at a recent dinner in Milan with her JW Anderson pigeon clutch.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjnUrVIj0j6/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Fashion illustrator Jenny Walton" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Fashion illustrator Jenny Walton</a> is a self-proclaimed “big fan of birds.” She’s wanted the clutch ever since seeing it on Jonathan Anderson’s Instagram page, and finally bought it when it became available in August. She’s had zero regrets since. “It’s worth every penny, because you make friends everywhere you go,” she says in an interview. “I’ve never had such a great conversation starter. Last night in the taxi in Milan, I went to pay and grabbed my cash out of the pigeon, and the cab driver totally lost it. He made me let him take photos!” I'd like to think that somewhere in Milan that night, there was a man passionately explaining this pigeon clutch to his partner, who has no idea who Jonathan Anderson is, over a red sauce pasta dinner. And that … that is the power of fashion.</p><img alt="jenny walton's pigeon clutch nestled in her lap while riding in a milan taxi" title="jenny walton's pigeon clutch nestled in her lap while riding in a milan taxi" width=3024 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-8803-1666069163.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Jenny Walton</span><p>Walton’s pigeon clutch nestled in her lap while riding in a Milan taxi.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The power of fashion is to also sometimes be unapologetically useless. Walton noted that the clutch won’t fit your phone, but can hold your “cards, cash, keys, lipstick, and a lighter,” which would explain why Bradshaw had to accessorize hers with a straight-off-the-runway Fendi ankle bag. But the pigeon bag doesn’t strive to be the most practical thing in your wardrobe. It transcends utility.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For Walton, it reminds her of the life she had in New York before moving to Italy, a time when she would occasionally rescue injured pigeons outside of Bergdorf’s and bodegas. And while she’s always viewed the bird as a “completely misunderstood” creature, she appreciates what the bag will do for the pigeon community at large. “The JW Anderson pigeon didn’t change my mind about pigeons—now I’m just happy other people are seeing the beauty in them too!”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Even some native New Yorkers, fabled pigeon haters, agree. It took Andrew Garn, a photographer from the city who published the book The New York Pigeon: Behind the Feathers, a while to come around to the bird. But once he started to photograph them, he quickly “got sucked into a cult of pigeon appreciation—beauty, intelligence, diversity, humor, and personality—pigeons have it all, and sometimes are so totally undervalued,” he tells me in an interview over email. As for his opinion on them as a fashion accessory, he says he couldn’t be happier “that people are paying more attention to pigeons.” He follows this statement with a portrait of a pigeon whose white overturned feathers engulf its neck like an elegant feather bolero.</p><img alt=pigeons title=pigeons width=1200 height=1697 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/unknown-1-1666198441.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Andrew Garn</span><p>The aforementioned elegant pigeon, photographed by Garn.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My family friend Ray López grew up with a pigeon coop his father built in his backyard in Queens in 1958. He’s not the biggest fans of pigeons now, but he looks back at his father’s flock fondly. As for his thoughts on the purse? “Wow, what a concept!” he tells me via text after I send him a photo.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I couldn’t get a comment on the record from any New York city pigeons themselves about how it feels to be commodified as a luxury item. (I imagine that feather bolero pigeon would be into it.) But as someone who has been called pigeon all of my life, I think I speak for them all when I say it’s about time.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
