Izzy Zapata and Stacy Snyder were one of five couples on Love Is Blind Season 5, which premiered on Netflix in September 2023. Love Is Blind, which premiered its first season in February 2020, follows around 30 men and women over the course of a couple weeks as they speed-date in “Pods,” where they can talk to each other but not see each other."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

During the 10 days, the couples can decide if they want to get engaged—still sight unseen. After the proposal, the couples meet face-to-face for the first time and go on vacation at a resort in Mexico, where they learn more about each other and meet the other couples. After the trip, the couples, who all live in the same city, return to the real world and move into an apartment together as they meet each other’s families and friends and prepare for their weddings. At the altar on their wedding days, the couples must decide whether to marry or break up as they answer the age-old question of if love can be truly blind.</p><p>Since the premiere of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Love Is Blind</a>, the show has become one of Netflix’s highest-rated series, with more than 30 million views in its first two months. “Across the world, everybody feels the same way: Everyone wants to be loved for who they are on the inside. It doesn’t matter where you live, what you look like, how old you are, what your background is, which class you know, or social structure you feel like you’re a part of, everyone wants to be loved for who they are,” creator Chris Coelen told Variety in 2020. “In today’s society we’ve got all these ways to find love through dating apps and technology. Those things sort of counterintuitively have made people feel disposable. They’ve made people feel like it’s all surface level. It does the opposite thing it was supposed to do. So we thought, what if we took everybody’s devices away, how could we get them to focus on connecting with other people?”</p><p>Coelen also told <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Variety</a> about how the connections on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Love Is Blind</a> were based on choice, which is why the relationships were that much stronger. “It was incredibly scary because nobody had to do anything, versus a show like we do Married at First Sight, you sign up and you know, you’re getting married to a stranger. Here, nobody had to do anything. It was if you find someone, if you choose. Which is so scary. They don’t have to go through with the wedding ceremony,” he said. “But assuming they found someone, could that love overcome any judgment in the real world? That’s an incredibly fascinating question. And that’s what we set out to try to examine.”</p><p>But back to Izzy and Stacy. So… are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Izzy and Stacy still together from Love Is Blind Season 5</a>? See what happened after their love square with Johnie and Chris.

The answer seems to be no. Stacy Renae Snyder and Ismael “Izzy” Zapata Jr. met and got engaged in The Pods on Love Is Blind Season 5. Izzy and Stacy were one of three couples who got engaged on Love Is Blind Season 5, along with JP and Taylor; and Lydia and Milton.</p><p>Izzy and Stacy were one of two couples who were issued marriage licenses from Love Is Blind Season 5, along with Lydia and Milton, according to public records from the Harris County Clerk’s Office in Texas, where Houston is located and Love Is Blind Season 5 was filmed. According to the records, Izzy and Stacy were issued their marriage license on May 20, 2023, and their marriage license was processed on August 29, 2022. The records note, however, that their marriage license was not returned and they are not legally married, which means they likely broke up before saying “I do.” At the time of Love Is Blind Season 5’s premiere, Izzy and Stacy were still following each other on Instagram. Izzy and Stacy confirmed they did not get back together in the Love Is Blind Season 5 reunion.</p><p>Izzy also seemed to confirm he and Stacy weren’t still together in October 2023 when <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>TMZ</a> published a photo of him with a woman who wasn’t Stacy. TMZ reported that Izzy and the woman were seen on what looked like a date at Hermosa Ink Collective in Hermosa Beach, California, where Izzy was seen resting his hand on the woman’s leg. That same day, Izzy also shares a series of photo of him getting drinks and eating pizza in Hermosa Beach, where he seemed to leave the woman out of.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.329258010118><h2>Who's Izzy from Love Is Blind Season 5?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Izzy-Love-Is-Blind-Season-5.jpg><p>Who’s Izzy from Love Is Blind Season 5?

But he’s yet to meet his perfect match, because he’s often “not on the same page emotionally” with his romantic partners. Izzy’s dream girl would be able to join him in the gym or on the beach for sand volleyball, so athletic women are top of mind. And, if she has blonde hair and beautifully colored eyes, it’s a plus.

In the pods, she’s seeking a ‘family-oriented, outgoing, and driven’ individual. Stacy needs someone who can keep up with her in the gym, as she’s a former college athlete who teaches pilates in her spare time. She’s seriously turned off by ‘one-uppers’ who ‘don’t have an awareness of other people.’ And if Stacy does find that one, he’ll have to be accepted by her family, as gatherings for games over the holidays are major events and get ‘super competitive.’”</p><p>Love Is Blind Season 5 is available to stream on Netflix.</p><p>Our mission at StyleCaster is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
