Rodgers, who has been vocal about his stance on vaccination, addressed the nickname during an appearance on '<strong>The Pat McAfee Show</strong>' last week.</p><p>"That's fascinating," Rodgers said. "I don't play for the Johnson & Johnson corporation I play for the New York Jets."</p><p>While some have criticized Rodgers for his dig at Kelce, the tight end himself didn't seem too bothered by it and even laughed it off in front of reporters during media availability. However, Rodgers has challenged Kelce to a debate on vaccination, with Kelce admitting he never thought he'd get into a vaccine war with Rodgers.</p><p>The vaccine wars show no signs of slowing down, as Rodgers continues to make headlines for his stance on vaccination. Ex-Surgeon General <strong>Jerome Adams</strong> recently criticized <strong>Rodgers</strong> for his comments about Kelce, stating that "it's not helpful to be calling out people for their vaccine choices." However, Rodgers remains steadfast in his beliefs and has even expressed his willingness to miss games if necessary due to the NFL's strict COVID-19 protocols.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>The controversy with Kelce continues</h2><p>Despite the controversy surrounding <strong>Rodgers</strong>' comments, many fans have found humor in the situation, with some even creating a "Mr. Pfizer" jersey in honor of Kelce. The ongoing vaccine debate has certainly brought attention to the issue, but it remains to be seen whether it will have any real impact on vaccination rates.</p><p>In the end, whether you agree with Rodgers or not, it's clear that he is passionate about his beliefs and isn't afraid to speak his mind. As he said on 'The Pat McAfee Show', "I'm not going to shy away from conversations that I think are important." And while the vaccine wars may continue to rage on, one thing is for sure: Aaron Rodgers isn't backing down anytime soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqedpWeemsRuxc6romailanAcH6Pa2poaWBkfnJ7lW5pbp5pl7GmfpZpa56clGyGea6Tb2dqZpipuq0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
