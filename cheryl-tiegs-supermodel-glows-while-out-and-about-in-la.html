Widely known as “America’s first supermodel,” Cheryl kicked-off her career at the young age of 17. “At the time, I lived in Alhambra, right next to Pasadena. My girlfriend next door kept coming over with ‘Seventeen’ magazine saying, “Cheryl, you could be a model,” the blonde beauty recalled to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Artful Living</a>. “I thought she was crazy. I thought models were from another planet, and it was just out of the realm of possibility.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cheryl-Tiegs-looks-youthful-3.jpg><p>“I started very slowly. I worked part-time in high school and college,” the fashion designer continued. “I would do anything and everything. I would do fashion shows in the back parking lot of a department store for free. I would work for $5 an hour, which was great money for me at the time. I was thrilled. I just worked hard, and I did anything and everything I could.” And then things accelerated in a flash.</p><p>“Then ‘Glamour’ magazine saw me in a several-page spread for a bathing suit. They were in New York and said, “We want to book this girl sight unseen to go down to St. Thomas,” the&nbsp;Celebrity&nbsp;<i>Apprentice</i> alum explained. “That was almost the first time I’d been on an airplane. I did several covers down there and began working for ‘Glamour’ regularly. “Fast-forward to today and Cheryl is one of the most celebrated models ever, and she doesn’t have a problem with the “America’s first supermodel” tag given to her.</p><p>“Someone of course gave me that title. I think it’s a way of saying that I didn’t just drop out of sight after a very successful career in modeling; I went on to start other businesses,” Cheryl explained during the same interview. “I worked for ‘<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Good Morning America</a>,’ and I started the line of clothes for Sears. When I was modeling, most of the girls became actresses, because that was the next logical step. I just decided I didn’t want to be an actress, and I started up these companies.”</p><p><strong>Scroll on down to see more photos of Cheryl on her outing!</strong></p><p>Be sure to check out and <a href=#>subscribe to our Classic TV & Film Podcast</a> for interviews with your favorite stars!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46cn56qqaF6tbXEoKpmq6WlsrO5zp2cpWWXoby4v4ywn6KklWK8tsCMmqWdZZGXvLbAjKKlZqSRZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
