Based on the Boston Symphony Orchestra/Boston Pops model, the PSA will become one board and one orchestra with two music directors. Serving as an umbrella organization, the PSA will continue to present The Pasadena Symphony winter season at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium under Music Director Jorge Mester.</p><p>The PSA will also present the newly named Pasadena Pops Symphony summer season at the Descanso Gardens under Music Director Rachael Worby. The PSA also has plans to expand the existing education and community engagement programs of both the Symphony and the Pops. The planned integration begins immediately, with dissolution of the Pasadena Pops Orchestra effective October 1.</p><p>Led by a combined board of directors and Executive Director Tom O'Connor, the newly energized PSA is positioned to deliver both symphony and pops symphony seasons at a high artistic level, increasing the organization's range of offerings, while deepening its reach in the community and increasing fundraising opportunities. "As The Pasadena Symphony approaches its 80th anniversary, and the POPS its 20th, both boards recognize the opportunity to enhance the quality of our artistic offerings and educational services for the Pasadena community and beyond through this strategic union," commented Linda Krantz, president of The Pasadena Symphony Association Board of Directors.</p><p>"This provides opportunities for the musicians to perform together year-round. Our concert programming will appeal to the widest demographic," Jorge Mester.</p><p><br>"Our education programs will expand into even more schools than ever before," added Harvey Knell, president of the Pasadena POPS Orchestra.</p><p>"Great live music must be the right and privilege of all people. The marriage of these two strong musical entities will surely prove that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It will provide our community with a platform from which to say to people far and wide that Pasadena cares about music," commented Worby. "I am honored and inspired to be a part of sending this message to the world."</p><p>–Bob Grossweiner and Jane Cohen</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaJuRlr%2BktMivnGiokaiupbHNmmSssZ2ltbC62GaYp5xdpa60rcOepZploKS9tHnOq5qhnaOpv6J506hknKedl7avsY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
