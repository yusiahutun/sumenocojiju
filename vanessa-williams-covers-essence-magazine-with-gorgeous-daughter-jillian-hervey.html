Ever. That wasn't the plan," the musician told the mag about her fierce curls. "That was the label. They were like, 'You need the hair, you need the hair, you need the hair!'"</p><p>"My hair was supposed to represent this freedom, and then it almost became a trap. You can't even see my face sometimes because the wig is so big," she added.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5b/o/2016/12/07/5b9b7de184235b7b99b4b85a2ab6cd18_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Williams, 53, also opens up to the publication about her some of her career setbacks, which include infamously losing her Miss America crown in 1983.</p><p>"You have to go through the fire," she said. "Avoiding the pain is why most people never resolve it. You have to dig deep, sit in it and ugly-cry. Pretending it's not there and keeping busy are a way of avoiding it."</p><p>As for her key to a successful career, Williams adds, "When they yell, 'Cameras ready!' I am the first one there. The director and producer notice. I take whatever I'm doing seriously."</p><p>According to Essence, the "Ugly Betty" alum was quite the proud mama on set during the photo shoot, snapping photos with her phone as Jillian posed for her solo shots.</p><p>The new issue of Essence hits newsstands Friday.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/10/o/2016/12/07/102ef7bb7f465379aa2805aeb469275a_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>For more of today's hottest headlines, check out the video below!</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/6f/16by9/2016/12/07/6f586df1eded59f4ad142efa357c1a47_md.jpg width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnd7kGtmaW9fq66vsdKsmGavmaG5qq3MrGScp6aav7R5xKyqnqaTmnqurcaasaKmlWLEqsDHZp6oqpeavLa%2FjJ2Yrp%2BYqbKzecmio6WhkaN6qbHRr5yyZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
