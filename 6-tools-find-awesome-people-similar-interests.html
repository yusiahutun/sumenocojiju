You'll have a larger support network that can appreciate your trials and victories. Additionally, if your hobbies include staying in shape or eating well, surrounding yourself with others who want to do the same is a great motivator.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Here are seven sites and apps, from&nbsp;online groups for shared interests to hobby apps, that help you connect with people with&nbsp;the same interests.</p><h2 id=meetup-web-ios-android>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MeetUp</a> (Web, iOS, Android)</h2><p>"Find your people" is Meetup's slogan, and the site delivers on this promise. It connects you with others who enjoy your interests by letting you search for groups or events within five miles of your location using any of the site's categories or your own terms.</p><p>This common interests website and its mobile app also let you start your own new group. While it's free to create an account and join existing communities, organizing your own meetups comes with fees. There are currently three Meetup pricing plans.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Costs vary by location, but a basic monthly subscription is around $15 to $24. A six-month plan is $10 to $17. Then, there’s Meetup Pro at $30+ per month. You can also ask members to contribute annually or chip in what they can to support the group.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Meetup for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id=vingle-web-ios-android>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vingle</a> (Web, iOS, Android)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/vingle-video-games-interest-members.png><p>If you just want someone to talk to at any given time without necessarily meeting up, Vingle is a great option. When you join the platform, you choose as many interests as you want. Then, your news feed brings up relevant posts and members you can interact with.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>It’s a social network, but one focused on connecting like-minded people. The fact that it’s completely free makes it a gem among online groups for shared interests. Chatting or getting advice about your favorite hobbies could not be easier.</p><p><a href=#>The top social media apps and sites</a> are fun and rich in different experiences, but they don’t always inspire the level of connection some users want. That’s the gap in the market that tools like Vingle are here to fill.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><strong>Download: </strong>Vingle for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=patook-web-ios-android>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patook</a> (Web, iOS, Android)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/patook-app-features.png><p>Another free platform popular for people wanting to make friends is Patook. You can access it through your phone or browser to start and build platonic relationships based on common interests.</p><p>Patook works like a dating app. Its algorithm uses a point system, ratings, and other factors to match similar individuals, who can then reach out to each other. There’s also a beacon feature that lets you interact or meet up with users near your location.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><strong>Download: </strong>Patook for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=we3-ios-android>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">We3</a> (iOS, Android)</h2><p>Today, there are more apps than sites that allow you to connect with other people with the same interests. Like Patook, We3 also follows a platonic recipe, matching users as friends and not dates.</p><p>Based on your detailed and private profile, We3’s intelligent algorithm puts you in “tribes” of three. From there, it’s up to you to chat, share, plan, or even leave a group you’re not happy with. A smart and simple system to meet new people.</p><p>If groups of three feel restricting, however, there are ways to work around it. Once you get to know enough people, you could move the conversation to WhatsApp or even a real outing. What We3 and other such apps offer is a safe environment to break the ice and inspire future fun activities.</p><p><strong>Download: </strong>We3 for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id=bumble-bff-ios-android>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bumble BFF</a> (iOS, Android)</h2><p>There really are loads of online groups for shared interests, especially mobile platforms. Bumble has set itself apart from the dating app competition by creating a friend-matching version of its service.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>All you do is download the Bumble app and fill in your details, hobbies, ambitions, and so on. Then, use the BFF mode to find people you’re likely to get along with. Whether you want to chat or hang out, the app has you covered.</p><p>Be aware of <a href=#>dating app privacy risks</a>, however, and how to protect yourself from them. As efficient as Bumble is, it can still be vulnerable to hackers and its own mistakes. Keep this factor in mind when exploring all of these online tools.</p><p><strong>Download: </strong>Bumble for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id=meetme-ios-android>6. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MeetMe</a> (iOS, Android)</h2>3 Images <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/meetme-app-profile-details.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/meetme-app-filters.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/meetme-app-privacy-settings.png> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>Not all social apps turn out to be good for just making friends, but those that do make a difference. Part of The Meet Group, MeetMe is another tool to keep in mind when looking for new people to add to your circles, whether they’re drinking buddies or online hobby groups.</p><p>The range of options available on MeetMe, including filters and tags, means that you can really narrow down your matches. You can also be extra specific on your profile about what you’re looking for. This way you can immediately get off on the right foot.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><strong>Download: </strong>MeetMe for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id=hobify-ios-android>7. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hobify</a> (iOS, Android)</h2><p>If you want even more engaging conversations, it might be worth focusing your search for online tools for specific hobbies instead of general social platforms. Hobify, for example, invites skilled people to promote their talents, as well as socialize about them.</p><p>You can hire all kinds of local professionals, from sign language interpreters to parkour athletes. At the same time, you can chat about your passions, get advice, and discover new experiences to enjoy with like-minded people.</p><p>Having fun while socializing takes interactions to the next level. Develop or pick up new <a href=#>creative hobbies&nbsp;for adults that can improve happiness</a>,&nbsp;like gardening or photography. Then, invite a Hobify friend to a nature walk, for example, so you can take pictures and get to know each other better.</p><p><strong>Download: </strong>Hobify for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id=ready-set-make-friends>Ready, Set, Make Friends!</h2><p>With so many online groups for shared interests available, from websites to apps, you can meet people even while staying at home. So, get online, find some new groups to connect with, and plan awesome activities for you and your new pals.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Are you a group of dancers, actors, or amateur sleuths? Whatever the common ground, there’s plenty to do. Even if you can’t meet in person, the internet is full of great bonding opportunities to enjoy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fa3q1u86lqmaemaOxbq3WnqqopZVivaa7z6WcZquZoratrdFmoKeslaeytMDSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
