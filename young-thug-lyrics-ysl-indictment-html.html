The<a href=#> 88-page grand jury indictment</a> refers to <a href=#>YSL</a> as a “criminal street gang” and lists 182 different acts — including instances of members wearing clothing or accessories with the word “Slime” — that were allegedly “in furtherance” of this collective conspiracy. Individual charges included murder, attempted robbery, and aggravated assault with a weapon. Georgia prosecutors also charged all 28 defendants with conspiring to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act by engaging in a pattern of illegal activity to obtain money and property. And controversially, rap lyrics from the <a href=#>Grammy-nominated musicians</a>, including a <a href=#>posthumous Juice WRLD single</a>, are also included as evidence. Of the 28 defendants named in the indictment, six are set to stand trial for charges, including the star Young Thug. The trial began on November 27 in Atlanta and is expected to last for the better part of a year.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl33exkqu000k3f72zm4rgzrc@published data-word-count=202>This isn’t the first time that rap music has been brought up during trials. In 2012, a Louisiana judge&nbsp;<a href=#>ruled</a>&nbsp;that some lyrics from “187” could be admitted as evidence in <a href=#>Boosie</a>’s murder trial. When Bobby Shmurda was accused of leading a gang connected to several crimes in 2014, his hit “<a href=#>Hot Nigga” was publicly scrutinized</a>, though the lyrics weren’t formally cited as evidence in the case. “I’m guilty for where I live,” he <a href=#>told Vulture at the time</a>. “I was never part of no gang.” More recently, prosecutors used the late <a href=#>Drakeo the Ruler</a>’s lyrics to accuse him of murder in 2019. That same year, <a href=#>6ix9ine</a>’s lyrics were introduced in court during his trial for gang-related charges. The practice of using rap lyrics as evidence doesn’t always lead to convictions; Boosie and Drakeo the Ruler were both acquitted. But regardless of whether the charges are true, critics say that the hyperbole in rap can unfairly sway a jury, noting that the practice has a disproportionate impact on Black and brown defendants. After Maryland’s highest court&nbsp;<a href=#>ruled</a>&nbsp;in December 2020 that rap lyrics could be admitted as evidence in a murder trial, veteran attorney Dina LaPolt&nbsp;<a href=#>told&nbsp;Variety</a>&nbsp;that the decision was “blatantly racist” and set “a dangerous precedent.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl33exqln000p3f72zr9437r4@published data-word-count=172>Last year, Jay-Z and other prominent artists publicly&nbsp;<a href=#>lent their support</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=#>Senate Bill S7527</a>, a New York bill known as “Rap Music on Trial,” which would acknowledge that rap is a form of artistic expression and limit the use of lyrics in criminal cases. The proposed legislation argues that the practice turns criminal courts “into instruments for suppressing provocative speech” and ignores “the foundational principle that a criminal case should be tried on the facts and not on a person’s ‘propensity’ to commit the crime.” The bill passed in committee in late January and is currently on the floor calendar for a Senate and Assembly vote. “No one ever thought that Johnny Cash was going to shoot a man in Reno just to watch him die or Bob Marley shot a sheriff but spared a deputy,” state Sen. Brad Hoylman, who sponsored the bill,&nbsp;<a href=#>told Fox 5 NY</a>. “That’s exactly what prosecutors are trying to convince juries about across the country.”&nbsp;Listen to the tracks and read the lyrics included in the lengthy YSL indictment below.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl30hqsss001k3g6r65r06n7u@published>“Slime Shit,” Young Thug feat.
