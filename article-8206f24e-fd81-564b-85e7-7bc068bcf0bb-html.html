That secret ingredient helped her win some extra green, too — $1,000 from Magnolia State Bank.
“I can’t believe I won,” she said, smiling and hugging new husband Terry Firment and team leader Sheriff Alex Hodge."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Second-place team Crossroads Catering got $500 and third-place Creative Computer got $250. Southern Hospitality won the People’s Choice award from the 1,000-plus people who attended and The Spirit Award&nbsp;went to Dunn Roadbuilders. SouthGroup, Chili Chokin’ Pepper Bellies and the Three Amigos rounded out the Top 6, according to the judges’ tastebuds.</p><p>“I know everyone can’t win first place with their chili, but the ultimate winner — The City Beautiful, Laurel — is the sole&nbsp;purpose for this and other events held in historic downtown,” Chili Cook Off Chairman Robby Scruggs said. “It’s people like you that are helping Laurel to quicken back to life.”</p><p>Scruggs said the 2015 event was the best yet, and Laurel Main Street Executive Director Judi&nbsp;Holifield agreed. There was so much interest, they had to cap the number of entries.</p><p>“This is becoming a premiere event for downtown Laurel,” she said. “It was a great day of Southern pride and community&nbsp;spirit.”</p><p>And as good as this&nbsp;year’s was, Scruggs said the 2016 will be even better.</p><p>“If you thought the wind this weekend almost blew off your feet, just&nbsp;wait until you find out what is going to go down at next year’s Magnolia State Bank’s sixth annual Chili Cook Off.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwuM6cmKVno52ys7XFn2SsZZSavaK%2B06acp6xdqa6ssdJmq6ioXZi1qrjIZqurp6CdxnCt0a2gnKSVlIVzfJWfaW2dXZuxeX2Mbm1tml1tgqaDjHCZnGhmba%2Bkso%2BbmWegpKK5</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
