Of course, his supportive girlfriend <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> was by his side along the way, and it looks like she’ll be by his side for a lot longer if their body language is anything to go by.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1970038974-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-s-body-language-shows-deep-connection-says-expert>Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s body language shows ‘deep connection,’ says expert</h2><p>As all eyes were on the couple this weekend, expert Darren Stanton kept an even closer eye on the pair’s body language, and what giveaways it gave us from their relationship, comparing it to her previous ‘fling’ with Tom Hiddleston in 2016.</p><p>He has outlined four signs, their kiss, her hands, how close they are and their personal space.</p><p>“From her [Taylor’s] body language, we’ve seen a lot of what is called ‘escalation’, through the way she’s kissing him, and her hands on his cheeks,” he told Slingo. “This is a very different sort of level to what was happening with Tom Hiddleston, the level of intimacy and proximal zones is different.</p><p>“We all have layers of skin, like layers of an onion, and we only allow certain people into certain closeness of those layers. With Taylor, some of the shots, they’re very, very close together and in each other’s personal space.”</p><p>“You just wouldn’t get that unless you had a very deep connection, a deep pull with somebody,” the expert continued.</p><p>Although many ‘cruel’ theories have emerged about the <a href=#>relationship being a publicity stunt</a> for the NFL star, Darren says the couple’s body language suggests they “do seem to be equally invested.”</p><p>The expert explained how the <a href=#>music</a> star was more ‘gushy’ than her partner at first, due to her being used to the paps and media attention, more than Trav was.</p><p>“It’s certainly clear now he’s evolved and is embracing the publicity and admiration and the attention the paparazzi give him,” he concluded. It seems very much like a two-sided coin compared with the start, when it was Taylor who was the one who was loving all the adulation”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-nfl-star-explains-how-the-couple-deal-with-outside-noise>The NFL star explains how the couple deal with outside ‘noise’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1961126081-1024x683.jpg><p>As the expert says, Travis and Taylor are surrounded by fans and paps wanting to know their every move, and he’s now opened up on how they deal with this.</p><p>“The only thing we’ve talked about is as long as we’re happy, we can’t listen to anything that’s outside noise,” the 34-year-old <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> during a team press conference. “That’s all that matters.”</p><p>He also shrugged off ‘outside noise’ from critics about his relationship with the pop sensation.</p><p>He said: “It’s just outside noise, dealing with everyone else’s perspective of things. You hear the media throughout the year if we’re not having success, maybe throw it out there that I wasn’t focused or that the team isn’t focused on certain things.”</p><p>The athlete then said that the people in the building “know exactly what’s going on.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2h9cMDAsqOoql2oxKqy06xkm6eUrnqtrc2grJqflWLApL7EmqSsZZmjwaq5wJywZq%2BZqbVuwNGaraKrXaCyra%2FEZpyxqJWnwW6%2FwLKqaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
