The following day, she had a hopeful update to share: Coleman is awake and breathing on his own, and he also was able to hug and talk to his family.</p><p>"God is good. Miracles do happen," Kenzie&nbsp;writes in <a href=#>the caption of a video </a>she shared to her dad's social media. "... We still have a long road ahead of us but we are truly thankful. We want to thank you all for the love and support from the bottom of our hearts."</p><p>In the video, Coleman is visibly emotional, but filled with gratitude as he embraces his family.</p><p>"I'm the happiest man in the world! I swear to God I'm so lucky. I can't believe my parents are alive," he says as he chokes back tears.</p><p>Despite all the positive emotions he felt, he was clearly still very weak, relying on a nasal cannula and bed rest in the hospital as he recovers. He also was still experiencing a wide range of emotions, including shock, horror and grief at the loss of his family's beloved dog.</p><p>"I had to make a decision," he continues. "'Cause I got out of my room and went to the door and it was already horrible. I couldn't breathe. I almost had to go outside. And I went back in and got 'em. I can't believe it."</p><p>"I got 'em, but I couldn't find Hammer," he says, before being overcome with tears.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>WWF Wrestling Legend Virgil Dead at 61</a></strong></p><h3 data-wpview-marker=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fp%2FC4f8qCQsmAS%2F><strong>Who&nbsp;Is Mark Coleman?</strong></h3><p>A native of Fremont, Ohio, Mark Coleman began his amateur wrestling career in the mid-1980s.
