If this family favorite tops your list of weeknight meals — or if you have a whole bunch of burgers leftover from your July 4th weekend BBQ — you may be wondering how to reheat a burger without drying it out. Take some time to check out these expert tips to reheating hamburgers and you’ll never have a disappointing meal of leftovers again.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Reheat a Burger in the Toaster Oven</h2><p>When it comes to choosing an effective and efficient way of reheating a hamburger, the toaster oven is a close second to the big oven. Since a hamburger patty is on the smaller side, they tend to warm up pretty well in here. <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">HelloFresh</a> chef <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Claudia Sidoti</a> shares her four steps for using the toaster oven:</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><li>Preheat toaster oven to 350 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. If hamburger patties are room temperature, they’ll reheat fast.</li><li>Place burgers on metal rack in toaster and place baking sheet underneath to catch any excess fat that drips.</li><li>Heat hamburger patties for approximately 3 minutes.&nbsp;</li><li>Turn hamburger patties and heat for an additional 2 minutes (exact time will depend on thickness of the patty).&nbsp;</li><p>If you want a nice toasty bun, Sidoti says you can add the hamburger buns to the toaster oven after you turn the patties.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Reheat a Burger in the Microwave</h2><p>Have you ever tossed a burger in the microwave, set the timer for a random amount, hit start, and walked away? If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone. While this method works, it certainly produces less-than-desirable burgers.&nbsp;</p><p>So yes, the microwave is on the bottom of the list when it comes to reheating grilled hamburgers most effectively — but we know that sometimes life gets in the way, and you need to get dinner on the table, pronto! We’ve got you covered with these easy steps from Sidoti to reheat a cheeseburger (or Hamburger Helper) in the microwave:</p><li>Locate “reheat” setting on microwave.</li><li>Place hamburger patties on microwave-safe plate. Put in microwave for 1 to 2 minutes. Depending on thickness of patties, turn them at halfway point.&nbsp;</li><li>Push finger down through warm patty. If patty is hot, it’s finished. If not, reheat for another 30-60 seconds.</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Reheat a Burger in the Oven</h2><p>Ah, the oven. There’s a reason this oldie-but-goodie seems to always stand the test of time. When it comes to a foolproof hamburger reheating method, the oven is your answer. “This is the favorite method for burger aficionados like myself, so you can rest assured that you’ll be enjoying a burger as delicious as one that’s fresh off the grill,” says chef Courtney Rada of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Carnivorous</a>.<strong> </strong>Here, she shares seven easy steps to reheat a burger in the oven:</p><li><span style=color:initial;font-family:var(--font-poppins)>Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.</span></li><li>Put patty directly onto metal rack and place over baking pan to catch excess fat drips.</li><li>Place patty in oven for about 3 minutes, depending on oven strength.</li><li>After 3 minutes, lay bun on metal rack and flip patty to its other side. (Tossing your hamburger buns into the oven too gives them a toasty finish. )</li><li>Cook for additional 2 minutes until bun is golden brown.</li><li>Doctor up your burger with veggies/extras of your choice, and enjoy!</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Reheat a Burger Bun By Itself</h2><p>Nothing ruins a burger faster than a cold hamburger bun. That’s why using the oven to reheat a bun by itself is the easiest way to get that fresh-from-the-grill taste. Since the oven is the preferred choice for burgers, it makes sense to go with this method when handling your buns. Here, Sidoti shares four simple steps:</p><li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li><li>Wrap both halves of bun in aluminum foil, ensuring all sides are covered.&nbsp;</li><li>Place wrapped buns in oven.</li><li>Reheat until warm, approximately 5 minutes.</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Reheat Fries</h2><p>What good is a juicy burger without a side of crispy fries? Rada says you have a couple of options to <a href=#>reheat your fries effectively</a>. If you plan on reheating your burger and fries together, allow for some extra time in the oven. Here are the two methods Rada recommends:</p><p><strong>Reheating Fries on the Stove</strong></p><li>Using a large, heavy skillet, heat up a bit of oil. Use oil with a high smoking point (think corn, peanut, or canola vs. olive) to ensure it doesn’t burn your fries.</li><li>Once pan is hot, add fries. Don’t crowd the pan and give fries plenty of room.</li><li>Keep moving fries around until they’re crispy and golden on all sides.</li><li>Let fries rest on a few layers of paper towel until all excess oil has drained.</li><li>Toss with your fave seasoning (Rada recommends a little salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder) and enjoy.</li><p><strong>Reheating Fries in the Oven</strong></p><li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.</li><li>Line baking sheet with foil and place fries on top, leaving enough room so they reheat evenly.</li><li>Place baking sheet in the oven and cook for a couple minutes (depending on how crispy you like them).</li><li>Keep moving fries around until they’re golden on all sides.</li><li>Remove from oven, toss in seasoning of choice, and let cool for a couple of minutes before eating.</li><p>There you have it: Three simple ways to reheat a burger. Grab a side of fries or <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">corn on the cob</a>, and you’ll have a leftover dinner guaranteed to make your taste buds sing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonainlGK%2Fpq%2FIqZysZ5ikxG7AzmapnqCVlsFurtSrnp6qow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
