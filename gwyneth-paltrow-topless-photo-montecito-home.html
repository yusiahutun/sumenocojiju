Leaving her top inside, Gwyneth was fresh from the pool herself as her golden locks were hanging wet down her shoulders and slicked back off her face. Having emerged from the pool, she was the picture of confidence and she had the appearance of being carefree. Her focus was on her stunning and tranquil surroundings. The actress admired the view from the pool, which was totally gorgeous, overlooking the sculpted trees and greenery.&nbsp;</p><p id=eONi2Ti3jo data-wc=13><strong>CUTE:</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Goldie Hawn's lookalike granddaughter is so grown up in rare family photo</a>&nbsp;</p><p id=efUxp-8ieXp data-wc=13><strong>REVEAL: &nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Daniel Craig's model daughter's photoshoot might be her most daring to date</a>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4a201c153d0c-gwyneth-paltrow-in-nude.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8c8c2d7b742c-gwyneth-patrow-poolside.jpg><p id=eZK5CumjVbE data-wc=58>As a wellness guru, Gwyneth has talked openly about body image and confidence over the years. She has shared her own hopes for “self-improvements” and talked about experiencing insecurities as a woman. "I don’t think I’ve ever met a woman that feels completely great about her body, and that’s a real shame," she previously told The Press Association.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/97c7039d0818-gwyneth-patrow-topless-poolside.jpg><p id=eAvJpxlrmAZ data-wc=72>"That means that we’re holding ourselves to some other standard that’s been prescribed to us and it’s very external as opposed to internal. At this point in my life, I’m definitely not a perfect person, but I’m always on a journey toward self-improvement. I really like myself. I know my faults. I don’t think I have blind spots anymore, and I’m trying to sort of cultivate that same feeling about my body."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/51b1b5a74eda-gwyneth-paltrow-wears-yellow.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a2853a81efd5-gwyneth-paltrow-yellow.jpg><p id=e0ZhZ8HHq7V data-wc=67>But turning 50 didn’t make Gwyneth nervous, in fact it made her feel inspired. She told PEOPLE: “I feel really inspired by turning 50. I used to care so much what people thought of me. Now I don't care. It's so nice. What I think it really means to not be caught up in what other people think is that it means that you're close to yourself.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a0aff3168237-gwyneth-paltrow-wears-blue.jpg><p id=etiUWphbxIE data-wc=58>She added: "I think that transition is particularly hard for a woman because of what society tells us about turning 40 and that in some way when we lose reproductive viability that we're no longer desirable or important or visible. But I really didn't have any [anxiety] turning 50. I felt like this amazing liberation started to come."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6cdde440526d-3474107032715874919816407152330571419470552n.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9e2649b7a2a3-gwynyth-paltrow-close-up-front-row-fashion-awards.jpg><p id=e6oAiDtodG data-wc=6>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
