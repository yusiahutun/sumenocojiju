Take away your feelings for Taylor…” which prompted a laugh from Travis.</p><p>Kelce said, “I think it’s fun when they show who was at the game.

Travis Kelce was not at the Eras Movie premiere because he had a Chiefs game against the Broncos in Kansas City, Missouri the following day. As for whether Taylor Swift will be in attendance at the football game, it was confirmed that she will be attending the game at Arrowhead Stadium to support Travis. It will be her third appearance at a game to support her alleged boyfriend.</p><p>Though Kelce didn’t make an appearance, Taylor Swift dazzled the red carpet at The Grove in Los Angeles with a blue Oscar de la Renta dress and walked through with her friends like Hayley Kiyoko and Beyoncé. Swift posted a picture of her and the Renaissance musician eating popcorn in an empty movie theater on <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/CySi6aqO07D/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a>. “I’m so glad I’ll never know what my life would’ve been like without @beyonce‘s influence,” Swift wrote. “The way she’s taught me and every artist out here to break rules and defy industry norms. Her generosity of spirit. Her resilience and versatility. She’s been a guiding light throughout my career and the fact that she showed up tonight was like an actual fairytale.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=17.073383084577><h2>Did Taylor Swift attend Travis Kelce's birthday?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/donna-kelce-taylor-swift.png><p>Just mere days before The Eras tour movie, it was Travis Kelce’s 34th birthday. Rumors circulated whether or not Taylor would attend Travis Kelce’s birthday</p><p>It had been speculated that the “Love Story” singer might have been headed to Kansas City to celebrate with her rumored beau ahead of his birthday. A day before Kelce rang in another trip around the sun, Swift was spotted leaving New York City.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Page Six</a>&nbsp;reported that Swift’s luggage was loaded into a car and taken to Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, though it was unclear at the time where exactly the pop star was headed next.</p><p>Despite earlier reports, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce did hang out for his 34th birthday, although they did so in secret. Swift quietly flew to Kansas City from Nashville on Friday, October 6, “to see Travis,” an insider told Us Weekly, after opting for a “chill night,” for his celebrations.</p><p>Some social media users are convinced that the&nbsp;Midnights&nbsp;singer and NFL star might have celebrated his birthday privately. “The fact that Taylor and Travis are both quiet on Travis’ birthday and have not been photographed anywhere tells me that they definitely did spend it together,” one social media user&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>speculated</a>. Another&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, “gonna wake up to a news story about how taylor and travis celebrated his birthday privately and there’s no evidence of it but it was totally genuine and super romantic.”</p><p>Shortly after kickoff at the Chiefs at Vikings game on October 8, 2023, NFL announcers confirmed Swift’s absence from the game. “In case you’re wondering, seven words I thought would never leave my lips in my career, what are they? Taylor Swift is not at the game,” commentator Jim Nantz told viewers. “There are some brokenhearted people I just saw in the stands. She was questionable all week, but it looks like it’s officially inactive for today.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/travis-kelce-jersey.png><p>Travis Kelce Jersey</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfqb%2BiwsisZKSdnJiybsDAsqOoql2oxKqy02acq5mjYsGwwdFmnaKknWK9s7HMopyrnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
