Crystals help you to be open.”</span></p><p>Askinosie and Hanekamp generously gave me a few rose-quartz rituals to incorporate into my life using specific routines they mapped out&nbsp;for me. Some are small; others are more time-consuming—but after each, I did sense a subtle change. It sounds woo-woo, but after Hanekamp’s&nbsp;ritual bath with red wine and rose petals—meant to help cleanse past hurts that can fester in relationships—my boyfriend and I got into a random fight about something small, but then we talked it out and proceeded to have&nbsp;great sex. During Askinosie’s “Love with a Partner” ritual, my boyfriend was a little giggly, but&nbsp;a serious expression came over his face when I took my turn sharing my feelings, and I could tell he appreciated hearing it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/9eab8-12093609_469998303182431_1122305963_n.jpg><p>Whether these moments were a result of the crystals themselves or the fact we were hyper-aware of our relationship for the sake of this story isn’t exactly clear, but taking the time to focus on feelings of openness is easy when you&nbsp;take the time to tap into it, and&nbsp;harder when you’re rushing through your days without pausing to pay attention.</p><p>Still, it can’t hurt to try the exact rituals I did, all listed below with examples of how each one affected me and my relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/6ccba-13652072_1174074695976129_1409667357_n.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>Self-Love Ritual<br></b></span><span class=s1>By Heather Askinosie&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Love yourself first.

Doing this nightly also clears any built-up frustration or negative emotions from the day, giving you a clean slate to begin again the next day.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/12fc2-13408783_832051670258124_197783099_n.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>Love with Partner Ritual<br></b>By Heather Askinosie&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>This ritual is about finding your inner middle.
