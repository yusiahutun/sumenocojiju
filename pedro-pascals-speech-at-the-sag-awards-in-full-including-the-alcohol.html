The celebrity seemed like he didn’t expect to win Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a drama series because he admitted he had a little bit too much to drink before he even made it on stage. But Pedro Pascal managed to still give a great speech when his name was called out at the SAG Awards."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But it seems he wasn’t expecting that to happen.</p><p>Pedro Pascal’s name was called out and after he made his way to the <a href=#>SAG Award</a> stage he told the world he had been drinking in his speech.</p><p>“This is wrong, for a number of reasons. I’m a little drunk. I thought I could get drunk,” he said.</p><p>“And thank you, HBO for … geez Louise, I’m making a fool of myself. But thank you so much for this!</p><p>“I’ve been in the union since 1999 so this is an incredible f*****g honor. To the nominees, all of you, I can’t remember any of your names right now.</p><p>“To Craig Mazin, Neil Druckmanm, Franny, Casey at HBO. It’s very appropriate you’ve given me a job because I grew up watching your network. I have no skills, I have no other interests, so the least you could do is give me a job.</p><p>“Franklin and Sue, you’re with me here tonight, and my family may be watching,” he continues, clearly choked up. “I’m not sure”.</p><p>Pedro Pascal then appeared to get teary-eyed during his SAG Awards speech, but managed to pull through to thank his family.</p><p>He then joked: “I’m going to have a panic attack and I’m going to leave”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-i-don-t-remember-what-i-said>‘I don’t remember what I said’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>It must have been a blur for the TV actor as he told Tan France backstage he couldn’t recall what he said on stage.</p><p>Pedro Pascal jokes: “I don’t remember what I said [in my SAG Awards speech]. I was just very surprised… Let’s YouTube it later”.</p><p>Pedro won for his role in The Last of Us, where he played Joel. Joel ends up becoming a stand-in father figure for 14-year-old Ellie, played by <a href=#>Bella Ramsey</a>. He is on a mission to deliver the teenager to scientists in the hopes she can save a post-apocalyptic world.</p><p>The star has praised their relationship on and off screen, praising the young actress for her work.</p><p>He told Beef’s Steven Yeun on Variety’s Actors on Actors: “I couldn’t have asked for a more anchoring, generous, thoughtful teenager. And I don’t mean to say that in a patronizing way.</p><p>“I relied on Bella for so much of the experience. We were both scared and shy about that, but Bella just inspired me to be mature about it.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2eCcLzEnamoZaCWwKSty6xkrKiVmrCpecCtZK2glWLAorOMmq6aqpSoeqq6jJ%2BspaRdnrukuNSdoKefXam1pnnApZqooJ%2BhfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
