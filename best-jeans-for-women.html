Once you find the best fit for your body, whether you are looking for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>jeans that work with a round tummy</a> or extra-long legs, they become a wardrobe staple, so it's a good idea to buy two (or three, or four!) pairs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That's where we come in. We spoke to celebrity stylists, polled our editors, and researched the top denim brands for women. Our picks for the very best jeans to shop now include a variety of styles, ranging from skinny, to cropped, straight, flare, boyfriend, and beyond.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-levis-womens-724-high-rise-straight-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Levi's Straight Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Levi's Women's 724 High Rise Straight Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/B2NTM7k1ZKaY8GyHs66-8X1LgX8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/levis-womens-724-high-rise-straight-jeans-7647eaa6160c40808e296f786884b8bb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The holy grail of denim, Levi’s has been perfecting jeans since 1853, so you can expect some serious craftsmanship backed by centuries of practice in their pieces. And while they’re known for balancing sturdy denim with comfortable fits, what really makes Levi’s such a glory to shop at is the wide range of sizes and lengths. As someone who leans on the tall side (I’m five foot eight), I’ve dealt with the disappointment of finding the most comfortable, flattering jeans, only to realize they’re two inches too short — with no other options available.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The 724 high rise jeans come with a top half that supportively hugs your curves, then stretches out into a straight cut. The cotton and elastane blend makes it equal amounts comfortable and stretchy, which is why they make for the perfect everyday jeans. And while it comes in two different colors (black and white), for some reason this blue version is $10 more than the rest.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size range: </strong>23-33 |<strong> Rise: </strong>High <strong>| Material: </strong>Cotton, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-comfortable-jeans-wit--wisdom-jeggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Comfortable Jeans</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>WIT & WISDOM Jeggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="WIT &amp;amp; WISDOM Jeggings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1ayy0U0ED97tpoy4tq0rmMCalnw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/wit--wisdom-jeggings-2d661c344767452493c2d2d304dc6546.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstorm</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you can find a jean that is cute, well-fitting, and comfortable, you've hit a winner. These soft and stretchy jeggings look like traditional denim, but feel like you're wearing leggings. They have light whiskering and fading to look like real jeans. Coming in petite sizes, you don't have to worry about these skinny jeans bunching at your ankles. With their tight fit, they are perfect for tucking into boots.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> 00-18 <strong>| Rise: </strong>Mid |<strong> Materials:</strong> Cotton, rayon, polyester, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-jeans-american-eagle-stretch-mom-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget Jeans</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>American Eagle Mom Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="American Eagle Stretch Mom Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Hrkc-wPRae5zVexi8t69yEkKneI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/american-eagle-stretch-mom-jean-dad4f69e0f3a442f9a1341eec1111f9a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>American Eagle</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">They're stretchy, they hold their shape, and they look good on nearly every body type. And since these jeans are available in sizes 000 to 20 and short, regular, long, and extra-long length, there's a jean for everyone. And at an amazing price, there's so much to love about these pants. The combination of their relaxed silhouette and high-rise waist makes them comfortable and supportive without feeling slouchy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> 000-20 <strong>| Rise: </strong>High |<strong> Materials:</strong> Cotton, modal, recycled polyester, recycled cotton, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-redone-high-rise-loose-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>RE/DONE High Rise Loose Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="RE/DONE High Rise Loose Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/i5VBNK5wergeapPqAZwJFU4wQHE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/redone-high-rise-loose-jeans-ded2a825e34e4336872a994faa3b8450.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Re/Done</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When I asked senior editor Chloe Anello what her favorite brand of jeans was, she immediately answered: RE/DONE. “They just fit so well. I have really wide hips and long legs, so it's really hard to find pants,” she claims. So while they come in at a slightly higher price point, the flattering fit makes it worthwhile, especially when finding jeans that fit can be a bit of a feat. These 90s inspired jeans resemble the kind of jeans your mom used to wear with its relaxed fit that goes to the floor and faded wash. Because they’re made from rigid denim —&nbsp;meaning the material is nothing but cotton — they don’t stretch. Because they’re not skinny jeans, we don’t see that as being much of an issue, but if you were hoping for a bit of a stretch, you won’t find it here.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size range: </strong>23-32 |<strong> Rise: </strong>High<strong> | Material: </strong>Cotton</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-skinny-jeans-good-american-good-legs-deep-v-high-waist-ankle-skinny-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Skinny Jeans</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>GOOD AMERICAN Good American Good Legs Deep V Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="GOOD AMERICAN Good Legs Deep-V High Waist Ankle Skinny Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/F-O6O095CO0OQSJqI7wwj8q4pp0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/good-american-good-legs-skinny-jeans-a7cd3a9de8d64617909043aa2b4a424a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Good American</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>They run small.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Chrissy Teigen, Ashley Graham, and Kelly Rowland are all obsessed with Good American jeans, and for good reason. Designed by Khloe Kardashian, the jeans are made to enhance all body types and sizes. The Good Legs style is a skinny sculpting jean with extra stretch and a flat tummy tech. No matter if you're curvy up top and slim on the bottom or vice versa, you won't experience any gapping in the waistband. They are slim-fitting all the way to the ankle, and women say they look just as great on petite shapes as they do on curvy, plus the style comes in a short and long inseam in addition to regular.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> 00-24 <strong>| Rise: </strong>High |<strong> Materials:</strong> Cotton, polyester, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-high-waisted-jeans-joes-jeans-the-raine></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best High Waisted Jeans</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Joe’s Jeans The Raine</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Joeâs Jeans The Raine" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/RJ3awjocYYN468s_t7j08YIPtT4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Joes-Jeans-The-Raine-4c80cd5cd5374c5c82433707d960b3a8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Joeâs Jeans</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>It runs a little small.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even as a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jennifer Garner and Jennifer Anniston favorite,</a> Joe’s Jeans might be lesser known to the masses, but the ultimate if-you-know-you-know brand amongst celebrities.

These are extra high-waisted, ending just above your belly button. The cotton denim has a little bit of spandex blended in, which gives it a comfortable stretch. It only comes in one color: a really dark gray with a subtle stone wash, which gives it a little more versatility when styled with the rest of your closet. One reviewer left a comment that it runs a bit small, so make sure to check the provided size guide before committing to your purchase.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size range: </strong>23-34 |<strong> Rise: </strong>High <strong>| Material: </strong>Cotton, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-midrise-jeans-rouje-germain-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Midrise Jeans</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rouje Germain Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rouje Germain Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BlMJUah9j_DmYau8bJUge5y5r1c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/rouje-germain-jeans-8fe79c33b9ce46368d735363419a5c6e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Rouje</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Rouje set out to create the kind of jeans you find at a vintage store, only with a slightly better wash and fit. The Germain pants curve around your tush to give it a little lift and come up to a mid-high rise, hugging your belly and ending just below your belly button. At a size 26, the straight cut pants are 41 inches long, falling just around your ankles (that is, if you are five foot nine like the pictured model). But for every waist size up, Rouje adds one centimeter in length, catering to those with long legs. However, for those who don’t need that extra length, you might need to take it to a tailor. If you’re not in love, though, Rouje offers a 15 day return policy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size range: </strong>24-34 |<strong> Rise: </strong>Mid-high<strong> | Material: </strong>Cotton</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-low-rise-jeans-ksubi-low-rider-muse-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Low-rise Jeans</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ksubi Low Rider Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ksubi Low Rider Muse Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/smKtAe0apB9HFazuJxfTT1-1Kpw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ksubi-low-rider-muse-jeans-2044471672ee486fa7a47b45c6089c90.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ksubi</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>The pants are very long.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After trying Ksubi’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">detached jeans</a> (and getting a lot of questions about them), I wanted to highlight one of their wide leg pants for their comfortable and flattering fit. Low rise pants have officially entered mainstream fashion again, and these baggy pants embody the revived Y2K style effortlessly. The light wash indigo jeans are made from premium rigid denim, so expect these to be quite sturdy and well structured. Ksubi always places their signature branded “flag” on the back pocket of their jeans — I removed it from my pair — makes for a recognizable and unique statement if kept on. Just note that the model pictured is six foot two, and the pants nearly reach the floor even with heels on. It’s likely these will bunch up at the bottom or you’ll need to get them hemmed.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size range: </strong>23-32 <strong>&nbsp;</strong>|<strong> Rise: </strong>Low <strong>| Material: </strong>Cotton<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cropped-jeans-frame-le-garcon-crop-manserra-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cropped Jeans</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Frame Crop Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Frame Le Garcon Crop Manserra Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8q7mrSs7rZaQLy3W06IJzhPai8k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Frame-Le-Garcon-Crop-Manserra-8c6d64cda01344e4bace0f51c8f53ca5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Frame</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These skinny jeans finish in a straight cut, well above your ankle, giving you the opportunity to pair them with boots (from ankle to knee-high) or use them as a pair of summer jeans. While the low rise cut and tight construction might look constricting, the extra comfort stretch denim used here actually makes these very flexible. As a matter of fact, one commenter pointed out that they stretched so much after a few wears that they actually turned into a larger size. Because of this, we think it might be worth sizing down, giving you more opportunity to break in the material without overstretching them.

They come with a distressed hem, high rise waist, and a loose cut. “Despite the casual look of the Agolde mom jeans, they can be dressed up by pairing them with statement pieces like silver metallic heels,” says stylist Michaela Leitz. We particularly love the frayed hem, but like all loose hems, you risk it growing as time goes on.

These jeans hug the rest of your legs in a gentle embrace, without being too constricting, and end in a straight opening. The casual look is brought to life with the subtle distressing on the left leg, although this detail changes with the three other colors — two of which don’t have any distressing to them at all. Otherwise, we’re impressed with Abercombie’s promise to become more inclusive, with a wide size range and five different length options.

Blended with 33 percent lyocell, the fabric feels more breathable and soft than rigid denim, but it keeps its shape more than jeans mixed with high amounts of elastane (this only has one percent elastane). The topanga jeans come straight down and dangle open around your ankles, which feels comfortable and relaxed, but the sleek design keeps it looking polished. Although you’ll notice that while the tarmac, ecru, and graphite colors come in the same clean-cut style, the two blue versions have distressed detailings around the knees.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size range: </strong>23-32 <strong>&nbsp;</strong>|<strong> Rise: </strong>High<strong> | Material: </strong>Cotton, lyocell, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-wide-leg-jeans-rag--bone-sofie-splice-high-rise-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Wide Leg Jeans</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rag & Bone Splice High-Rise Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rag &amp;amp; Bone Sofie Splice High-Rise Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ZYZAfloMzKhIQhWp36logeoiRVY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Rag--Bone-Sofie-Splice-High-Rise-Jeans-cad996bbdf8a4a0ab3da0772edcade14.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Rag & Bone</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These (extra) wide leg jeans from Rag & Bone, a brand loved by celebrities like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jennifer Aniston and Katie Holmes</a>, instantly caught our attention — aside from the obviously large flare and loose fit, the diagonal seams coming in across the pants give it an added visual distinguisher that’s missing in a lot of the other options.

High-rise jeans are beloved for their ability to highlight the smallest part of your waist as well as create the illusion of long legs. They go great with crop tops and can even convert a bralette into a blouse. However, they can be tricky to style with longer tops and sweaters, especially if you can't easily tuck the top into the jeans.

Plus, a mid-rise goes with just about any top.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Wash</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It's smart to have jeans in different washes to go with different occasions and seasons. Dark wash jeans tend to look more sophisticated, so they can be easily dressed up for the office or for a date night. They also tend to be more slimming, so it's no surprise that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>black jeans</a> are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>models' go-to for their off-duty uniform</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you like to wear jeans in warmer weather, having a few light wash pairs is a must. They give off a casual, laid back vibe that's perfect for vacations and weekend plans. White jeans are the quintessential summer denim, but there are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>plenty of ways to style them all year long</a>. And like the mid rise, a medium wash jean is the perfect in between shade that can be worn regardless of season and occasion.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fabric Content</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not all denim is created equal, and when it comes to its make up, there seems to be two camps — those who want some stretch and those who want no stretch at all. If you prefer the look and feel of rigid denim, go for styles made from 100 percent cotton. Overtime, these jeans will stretch out to your body, achieving that customized fit you often find in thrifted jeans worn by previous owners.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If the thought of breaking in your jeans does not sound fun, go for blends that have a little bit of spandex or elastane. They will be comfy on the spot, and offer stretch and recovery throughout the day. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Paige Adams-Geller</a>, co-founder and creative director of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Paige Denim</a>, once told InStyle that jeans made from mixed materials are better at holding you in and retaining their shape.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I find the right fit while shopping online?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finding jeans that fit right is hard enough in person — shopping online is a whole different feat. To make it easier, Welch says it's important to look at the inseam, rise, and model's measurements. The inseam tells you the length of the jeans from the base of the zipper to the leg opening. The rise is the distance from the waist band to the crotch seam. In other words, the inseam tells you where the jeans will hit your legs while the rise tells you how high they will go up your torso.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To conceptualize these numbers, many sites list the height of the model and the size they are wearing. Based on how the pants fall on the model, you can decide what size to choose and if you should consider <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>jeans made for a short torso</a> or a longer inseam for taller frames, to give two examples.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I take care of jeans to make them last?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Once you find the perfect pair of jeans, you want them to last forever, right? The secret to extending their life is not to wash them too often. In fact, Levi's recommends that you only wash denim every 10 wears at most.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you do wash your jeans, follow these rules: "Wash jeans inside out, then hang them up to dry," says Adams-Geller. "If you don't like the crispy texture that results from air-drying, throw them in the dryer for 10 minutes on the tumble setting. It's not hot, so it won't blow out the Lycra and cause stretching." To <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>prevent the color from fading</a>, especially black jeans, always use cold water and the gentle cycle.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I dress jeans up or down?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These days, jeans are as acceptable in the boardroom as on the beach. For more casual outfits, Welch suggests going with distressed styles and pairing them with sneakers. To dress up a pair, switch to heels or sandals and add a belt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The top you wear immediately changes the formality of an outfit. Nothing says casual more than a simple tee paired with jeans. For a night out, consider tucking in a bodysuit or corset with some jeans. Throwing on a blazer or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>leather jacket</a> can instantly elevate the look too.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How much should I expect to pay for a pair of jeans?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While they can range from less than $20 to well over $200, the price of a pair of jeans doesn't always reflect the quality of the denim. Our best overall pick, The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Levi's 724 High Rise Slim Straight</a> style, rings up at under $60 but can last for decades, while cheaper jeans from fast-fashion brands may not stand up to years of wear. Learn to look for the hallmarks like high-quality denim (and a minimal amount of synthetic material), reinforced pockets, and durable hardware. If you care about sustainable production processes, check to see if the brand provides information on how they source and treat their denim.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop with Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Emily Cieslak</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Bianca Kratky </a>are commerce writers for InStyle, with a combined four years of experience covering fashion and beauty.
