Several cross-border traditions still carry over in the city of around 80,000 to this day – it was considered part of the North until the 1953 Korean war armistice – but is now notable for producing a promising UFC featherweight.
“I still can’t believe it’s actually happened,” said the 28-year-old Choi (9-3) after stunning the bookies by beating Youssef Zalal (10-4) via unanimous decision at UFC Fight Night in Las Vegas last weekend."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Nicknamed “Sting” for his venomous striking ability, Choi was a former national Muay Thai champion before switching to MMA.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I lived in Sokcho until I was 18. To be honest, when I started Muay Thai there weren’t many fighters or coaches at all, but I had this idea to become the best martial artist and tried to do it myself. There’s a lot of nature in Sokcho, so I would climb up mountains with my dad every day – no complaining about the lack of resources or whatever – and worked towards that dream,” said Choi, speaking to the Post while undergoing mandatory quarantine back home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/02/19/e733d6ea-70ed-11eb-ba58-f8f0a43119e3_1320x770_092300.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Originally, I wanted to be a K1 [kick-boxing] fighter. Then I went to the army [for mandatory military service] and started watching UFC with my family during the holidays. Soon my mission was to debut in the UFC. That’s when I started MMA.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The win over highly touted Moroccan Zalal has propelled Choi up the featherweight division and into contention for bouts against ranked fighters. He is now 2-2 since joining the promotion in 2019.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Choi, who trains in Seoul, said his last performance marked a turning point in his career. He was originally slated for another fight but replacements twice pulled out from Las Vegas on a week’s notice.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m thrilled to be a on a two-fight win streak. I finally had a chance to show the fans who I am and my desire to go up the rankings. These future fights will be the ones where I can really show my ability,” said Choi, who debuted in the UFC as a short-notice replacement against undefeated Russian Movsar Evloev (14-0).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I was a massive underdog and there were a lot of comments from overseas saying I didn’t stand a chance against Zalal. I wondered why they thought that because I really felt I could beat him. I wanted – needed – to prove them wrong in the Octagon as soon as possible.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/02/19/90eaf38a-70ee-11eb-ba58-f8f0a43119e3_1320x770_092300.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This fight was so much more important [than my first win in the UFC] because it would decide my future contract. I wasn’t sure I’d get one if I didn’t win, so I was training desperately and wanted to win in big and stylish fashion.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A former two-time champion in Korean promotion Top Fighting Championship, Choi unleashed a Conor McGregor-esque performance. From crafty shoulder strikes to much-improved takedown defence – long considered his Achilles’ heel – he earned praise from legendary fighter-analysts Daniel Cormier and Dominick Cruz.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m really thankful because their comments were spot on – I’ve been working very hard on Octagon control and takedown defence. I’ve been practising that for about a year and two months now – it shows it was worth it,” said Choi, whose previous fight was in December 2019.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You have to be well-rounded to survive in the UFC, so since I’m good at stand-up, I try to work on wrestling and clinching. I also think you have to fight stylishly to attract fans and compete in the UFC for a long time.</p>“I really admire <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Max Holloway</span></a>, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Dustin Poirier</span></a> and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">‘The Korean Zombie’</span></a> [Jung Chan-sung]. They all have driven, bulletproof mentalities. You can see them progress every time they step in to fight. I’m learning a lot from their fight management.”<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Though Choi’s UFC adventure is only warming up, South Korea’s once-fledgling representation across the men’s and women’s divisions has dwindled to just seven fighters – and “Sting” wants to be the first from his nation to have president Dana White strap a belt around him.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s an honour to be one of the Koreans fighting in the UFC but I don’t feel any pressure. I’m just eager to show my style and become a role model and influential fighter. I want people to know more about Korea.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I also want to study English more so I can communicate with fans and become a more valuable fighter,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My plan for the future is to work up the rankings and fight against some higher-ranked fighters. Eventually, I want to be a top 10 fighter then become the featherweight champion.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Additional reporting by Yeo Ji-won</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mppmiqbaiuIyaqa2rX6K2ubHDZqSaqqSerq15wKurrGeRp8Gqr8ueZmxpYmd%2FeYCOrp2cZaOkwrW0jKSmq52Ro3qntcahq56qXZi1sLWMrJyuppdixLC70g%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
