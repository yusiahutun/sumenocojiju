In fact, most of these celebrities get their visages contoured with makeup or wear their hair differently that it is nearly impossible to tell their true facial outline.</p><p>However, paparazzi and fashion police have followed these celebrities around, with or without makeup, and given us a glimpse of what they look like beyond the limelight. A lot of them have perfectly round faces, and here are a few of them:</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Queen Latifah</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2020/01/queen-latifah-round-face.jpg><p>Back in the day, it was really hard to tell if Latifah had a round face because of her broad jawline. However, she has put on some weight of late revealing her true facial shape which is circular. Latifah is also known to be one of the few celebrities who love wearing her hair natural. She takes good care of it, and it continues to compliment her lovely face even in her late 40s.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mila Kunis</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2020/01/mila-kunis-round-face.jpg><p>Don’t let the dodge and burn on Photoshop fool you; Mila Kunis rocks a perfectly round face and a hypnotizing smile. From Ukrainian descent, Kunis has made a name for herself in Hollywood as a budding actress. Her acting career debut in 1995 when she played Melinda in the movie, Make a Wish, Molly.</p><p>Kunis has also had notable roles in movies like Black Swan (2010), A Bad Moms Christmas (2017), and The Spy Who Dumped Me (2018). Kunis has a round face which is complemented with her hair worn back.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cameron Diaz</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2020/01/cameron-diaz-round-face.jpg><p>Like Kunis, Diaz also captivates you with her smile and perfect blue eyes. However, she can be giggling and love-struck as Tina Carlyle in The Mask (1994) or carefree and irresponsible as Elizabeth Halsey in Bad Teacher (2011). Diaz’s wide and blonde hairline coupled with her puffy cheekbones is what qualifies her as a round face.</p><p>We worship her smile and swoon to her laughter as the beautiful Diaz, who makes up one-third of the Charlie’s Angels (2000), continues to wow us with her daringness in acting.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Penelope Cruz</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2020/01/penelope-cruz.jpg><p>Round face, cupid lips, and a sexy Spanish accent is part of what makes up the striking Penelope Cruz. Her fluency in both English and Spanish has allowed her to navigate between Hollywood and Latin limelight with great ease. Cruz has played Sofia in Vanilla Sky alongside Tom Cruise, and Angelica in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides alongside Johnny Depp. She has also played Maria Alvarez in Bandidas and Silvia in Jamon Jamon.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Beyonce</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2020/01/beyonce-round-face.jpg><p>It is hard to tell Beyonce’s round face because of the long tipped chin. What gives her away is the wide hairline and defined cheekbones. We have seen her grow from Destiny’s Child with hits like Say My Name and Soldier to the bold Sasha Fierce of Lemonade.</p><p>Beyonce does some acting on the side as well and she is a talented dancer on stage. In fact, the best way to experience Beyonce is by attending one of her concerts. Until then, we get to gorge on her social media photos depicting her perfect circular face.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Hayden Panettiere</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.glossyfied.com/file/2020/01/hayden-panettiere-round-face-1024x576.jpg><p>Most of us came to truly fall in love with Hayden when she played Claire Bennet in the 2006 to 2010 TV show, Heroes. However, Hayden has been featured in movies too with some of her best performances seen in flicks like Remember the Titans and A Bug’s Life.</p><p>We don’t even have to squint; her circular visage becomes clearly pronounced as the now mature Hayden ages like fine wine.</p><p>Interestingly, most celebrities with round faces are actually women. However, we are pretty sure there are round-faced <a href=#>male celebrities</a> hiding in the interwebs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjOrKqynpmasW%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOinKxlp57BqXnRqKynnF2brqSx0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
