Ashley and her partner of four-and-a-half years Tommy have named their little girl Ada Isabella Blue Andrews, a sister to their two-year-old son Alfie.
Explaining the reasoning behind her name Ashley, 35, says: &#34;We thought Ada was a really beautiful name and I was also inspired by Ada Lovelace, who was a famous mathematician and scientist."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She was hailed as inventing computer programming and Tommy works in tech, so we liked that link. Isabella is named after my gran who is an amazing woman, and we chose Blue because Alfie's middle name is Rivers and I love water references."</p><p id=etNXgKhkn7j data-wc=31>Ashley also tells the magazine that <a class=hm-link href=#>Alfie was first introduced to his little sister</a> just hours after she was born on March 4 weighing 7lb 9oz at London’s St Thomas's Hospital and he took to his new role immediately.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4c510d04f58f-ashley-children-z.jpg><p id=ef-_qRlxNuZD data-wc=5><strong>Ashley with Alfie and Ada&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=efmBBIummfnd data-wc=51>"Alfie has actually been amazing - a lot better than we thought because typically he prefers older kids. He'll give her lots of cuddles and kisses and keeps saying 'baby sister'. We have to be a bit careful because he's quite over enthusiastic but he has shown her so much love."</p><p id=eO4Fz8gAS0Bq data-wc=54>The baby was delivered via caesarean section, with the birth planned on the day that Ada was 39 weeks, so Ashley and Tommy checked into a hotel near the hospital the night before, enjoying a last date night before arriving at St Thomas’s at 7am. At 9.04am, Ada made her way into the world.</p><p id=eeH6p7Ed3NOu data-wc=1><strong>LOOK:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Archie's red hair showcased in stunning photo you nearly missed</a></strong></p><p id=eTnlKxiwtcLd data-wc=64>"It was really calm,"&nbsp;she recalls. "I got to pick my own music playlist and they said to me: 'If you want a specific song for the birth, you can put that on now as she'll be born in the next minute.'&nbsp;It was really emotional. I was crying once I lay down because I was thinking: 'I&nbsp;have waited so long for this.'"</p><p id=epnG7d9NZZGf data-wc=27>As the George Ezra song Be My Girl was played, Tommy started to cry and then, when London Song by Matt Hartke came on, Ada was born.</p><p id=eJN74oMypACc data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Queen's close friend given honour in late monarch's Demise Honours</a></strong></p><p id=eH3chCwKv9e8 data-wc=43>"Seeing her for the first time was surreal. And I definitely did have that 'love at first sight'&nbsp;feeling, which I didn't have with Alfie, probably because of how traumatic it was. I was very excited but mainly just grateful she was okay."</p><p id=ePitUUpJ7tOz data-wc=39>Tommy cut the cord and was as moved as his partner. "We both felt really emotional. She was crying but the moment they put her on my chest she stopped so it was like 'Oh, she recognises her mummy.'"</p><p id=eCPN3uzeGM7l data-wc=38><strong>To read the full article, pick up the latest issue of HELLO! on sale now.&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Subscribe to HELLO!</a>&nbsp;to get the magazine delivered free to your door every week or purchase the digital edition online via our Apple or Google apps.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKSorJiav26tzZ1km5mSrnxzfJFsZ2xqZmaDeIGXb2aaq5ihsrp5yZqknqtdnru1vs6drJydo2Kvoq7YZp6iqpxiu6K5xGacsZucqsCqwsRo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
