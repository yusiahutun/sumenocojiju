During the summer months, the air inside your home is often cooler than the air inside, but with too much indoor humidity, moisture in the air can cause dangerous moulds and mildew to grow.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to prevent condensation on windows</h2><p id=e3ExU2pmoLOV data-wc=28>Cleaning experts Kärcher have shared their top tips to tackle condensation, including the must-have gadget to remove moisture, and how to prevent condensation developing in the first place.</p><h3>1. Remove moisture before it has time to set in</h3><p id=eGKclYPOoyYW data-wc=89>Soaking up or drawing in the moisture from the room before it has time to manifest can be an easy way to combat condensation and prevent damp from occurring. Unconventional methods include putting cat litter in a sock, tying it up and placing it on a window sill. Putting a bowl of salt on the window sill has also proven to be a good hack. If you’re able to invest in the solution, there are some great humidifiers on the market which absorb all the moisture in the air.</p><h3>2. Vacuum the damp away with a window vacuum</h3><p id=eK8t8nKpX_BI data-wc=74>Cleaning up condensation with a Window Vac can get instant results with a simple swipe. The WV 6 Plus N is Kärcher's most advanced window vac that effortlessly sucks up moisture leaving flat surfaces sparkling clean and streak-free. Kärcher Window Vacs are also a great time-saver as the powerful and rechargeable lithium-ion battery can clean up to 75 windows on one charge - getting the job done three times faster than conventional cleaning methods.</p><p id=ePDzXi49VKVs data-wc=25>Window vacuums can also be used on any flat surface in the home including windows, showers, and mirrors, ensuring they all stay spotless and streak-free.</p><h3>3. Let the air in</h3><p id=eeeboja7XJ6W data-wc=64><strong>Keeping windows and doors shut throughout the winter months can have negative effects</strong>. Ventilating the home by opening the windows for even just 20 minutes a day can drastically reduce the effects of condensation and dampness in homes. Keeping windows open during activities that cause a lot of moisture in the home such as cooking, showering, and drying clothes can also help minimise condensation.</p><h3>4. Ensure your home has good insulation</h3><p id=e7jGmUOhLuBn data-wc=52>Investing in reinsulating the walls of the house could be worth considering if condensation is a recurring issue in your home. Not only will this keep your home warm and reduce costs for heating, but <strong>having good insulation greatly determines how much condensation builds up and how long it takes to dry.</strong></p><p id=eiB3IrFaZ--e data-wc=12><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>10 best draught excluders to reduce household energy bills this winter</a></strong></p><h3>5. Keep the room temperature regulated</h3><p id=evs1JzMRrMAj data-wc=98>Keeping rooms in the house at a regular warm temperature will stop surfaces from getting cold enough for condensation to build. The heating doesn’t need to be on constantly throughout the day, but a timer can be used to switch on the heating during the coldest periods, or for a period during the night to utilise lower energy rates to save on energy bills. Keeping surfaces warm will prevent condensation from forming. Before switching your heating on for the first time in the winter, take the time to <a class=hm-link href=#>bleed your radiators</a> too to ensure they are running efficiently.</p><h3>6. Move your indoor plants and furniture</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bbfbea3f6333-plant-on-windowsill-z.jpg><p id=enc7I4uRv9no data-wc=32>Indoor plants that live on the windowsill naturally release moisture into the air. Consider moving them away from the window during colder months to help reduce the amount of water they release.</p><p id=eyooPRCZ5ik4 data-wc=53>If possible, furniture near external walls should also be moved as far away as possible to allow for air to circulate more freely. Your plants may thank you for it too, as window sills are often much colder in winter than in summer and plants like to maintain an all-year round ambient temperature.</p><h2>How to avoid condensation in the summer</h2><p id=eiWjD2rTnFjZ data-wc=32>Controlling the&nbsp;condensation&nbsp;on your windows in summer means reducing the humidity – the moisture levels – in your home, and the most effective way to do that is with adequate ventilation.</p><p id=evX3K5zEaqkr data-wc=29>Dry clothes outside when possible. If you use a tumble dryer, make sure it's vented to the outside. And always use the extractor fan when you're cooking or bathing.&nbsp;</p><p id=e5lrP2zWAzq9 data-wc=36>Sarah Hitchings, Sales and Marketing Director at <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Residence Collection</a>, comments: "With the summer season being met with a long period of rain, people will be concerned about the effects condensation will have on their home.&nbsp;</p><p id=ei11hohEbZFN data-wc=64>"Many people are searching for ways to lower the humidity in their homes without paying the price tag for running a fan or air conditioner during the cost of living crisis. Just by simply changing a few home habits while it's warm during a rainy season and having the right ventilation, people can have a much more enjoyable summer without worrying about summer condensation."</p><h2 style=margin-bottom:.0001pt><span style=line-height:normal><span><span style=color:#000>Will a dehumidifier get rid of condensation?</span></span></span></h2><p id=eelocsipdR7g style=margin-bottom:.0001pt data-wc=73><span style=line-height:normal><span><span style=color:#000>Things can be a little trickier in the winter, of course, but there are some simple solutions available to help alleviate the problem.
