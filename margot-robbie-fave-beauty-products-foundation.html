Margot Robbie - the star of the movie - is my latest girl crush, especially after all the promo for the movie when we all watched the actress nailing look after look in the run up to the movie's release. 
With that in mind, it's come to my attention that 33-year-old Margot Robbie has a few go-to foundations that she just loves."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We've unearthed an interview she did with <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">British Vogue</a> where she spilled the beans on her most-used skincare and makeup essentials.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/190f83738b86-margot-robbie-gettyimages-1530564778.jpg><p id=enwaXszPIu4 data-wc=63>On the subject of makeup, she said: "For everyday I use either <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturiser</a> or <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored nofollow">Ellis Faas Skin Veil Foundation</a></span> mixed in with some moisturiser, or if I go to events I use <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored nofollow">Suqqu Foundation</a></span>. That sh*t doesn’t come off. It looks like skin, but it doesn’t budge. I haven’t found another foundation that stays on like that without looking heavy."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eIwk6H56epy data-wc=35>While I've not tried Ellis Faas before, the other two products I also think are brilliant. <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Laura Mercier's Tinted Moisturiser</a> is a dream to apply and also gets the seal of approval from many celebrities.</p><p id=eFKwisr-9oU data-wc=105>Like Margot, I like to wear a heavier foundation for an event (ok, my events are slightly different to her events but whatever!) and the <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">Suqqu Foundation</a></span> is a hero for long-lasting foundation. It's the kind of makeup you wear and you feel flawless. I'm 39-years-old and the Japanese brand's foundation blends seamlessly and doesn't settle into fine lines or wrinkles. It also gives a lovely glow to the skin. I do think it's quite expensive but you don't need to apply much. I also like that it's in a jar (but that is personal taste as lots of people prefer bottles with pump action).&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b6cecd67f160-suqqu-foundation-and-product.jpg><p id=eZF5gC4-nMc data-wc=42>The price tag might be to do with the fact that the foundation is infused with 13 Japanese-sourced extracts (think green tea and silk protein), so the formula leaves skin smooth and hydrated while blending seamlessly and staying luminous throughout the day.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=ed50tqXeD9 data-wc=70>The interview Margot did with Vogue might be a little old, and of course she's also a huge fan of Chanel makeup as well nowadays. The Aussie actress' makeup artist - the iconic Pati Dubroff - exclusively used Chanel beauty products on her celebrity client during the press tour for Barbie. Taking to Instagram, the makeup artist revealed that this was her favorite beauty look out of all of them...&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dffb1f4511e6-margot-robbie-foundation-gettyimages-1540362459.jpg><p id=e7sXGHEE6Zm data-wc=41>She wrote: "Brit Barbie. This might be my favorite makeup from the whole tour. Margot Robbie IS a dream face to paint on." One of her go-to foundations was the <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored nofollow">Chanel Les Beiges Healthy Glow Foundation Hydration and Longwear in B30</a></span>.&nbsp;</p><p id=e2xsBHHM0GK data-wc=36>Another foundation I adore. So basically, what I'm trying to say here is that Margot Robbie and I are so alike and we could even share makeup bags on a night out and be best friends.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Margot Robbie's favourite foundations</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfqLWwvM%2BipaBnZG6Fc4OUaKSaqpekwW6%2BzpuZop1dm663sYybnJqtpK56sb7OnaycrKNis7DBzZ2YraGfo3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
