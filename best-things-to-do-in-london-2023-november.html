Every six weeks, a fixed-price, six-course set menu of expertly crafted dishes promises take diners on a culinary expedition through a rotating themed menu; inspired by people, places and memories.</p><p>The menu in question when I dined at <a href=# rel=nofollow>Six by Nico's Canary Wharf</a> restaurant was 'The Street Food Experience', featuring dishes inspired by the colourful soul food of Mexico City, the fusion flavours of Seoul and the hearty heat of Goa, to name a few. Having already tried chef Nico Simeone's illustrious 'The Chippie' last year, I had high expectations for a menu that competed with London's talented offering of diverse street food.&nbsp;</p><p>From my very first bite into a Gochujang Pork Steamed Bun I knew I was in for a treat; a sentiment I noticed was shared by the tables of wide-eyed, smiling people diving into each moreish mouthful. While I loved the nostalgic, child-like charm to The Chippie's imaginative dishes, The Street Food Experience is slicker and sophisticated without the need for fun additions like a battered mars bar and iron bru sorbet. &nbsp;</p><p>What is so exciting about Six by Nico's concept is the price. Six plates of exceedingly delicious and indulgent dishes will set you back £48 per person, and with a £35 optional wine pairing add-on, the value seems too good to be true.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Street Food Experience will be served up at Six by Nico until 17th December.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0a99d68fc063-sea-containers.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=0a99d68fc063-sea-containers>Enjoy a delectable Thanksgiving meal at Sea Containers</h2><p>The Thames-side restaurant at <a href=# rel=nofollow>Sea Containers</a> is a favourite of mine at any time of the year, but their Thanksgiving offering is definitely one to be enjoyed if you fancy celebrating this year. The menu is the perfect mix of traditional turkey dinner with the high end tastes you'd expect at this five star hotel.&nbsp;</p><p>I lived in the US for four years and this is literally my favourite holiday - just about spending time with loved ones and feeling thankful for your blessings. When I went along to Sea Containers to taste-test their menu earlier this month I was definitely giving thanks for that! The Norfolk Turkey was melt-in-the-mouth and the cranberry relish perfectly sweet and sharp. My personal favourite were the brussel sprouts - served with pecans. Nobody does savoury and sweet quite like the Americans at Thanksgiving and this meal perfected the combination. Dessert of pumpkin pie and cream was pretty good too!&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/004b2c27fa95-cd16752.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=004b2c27fa95-cd16752>Celebrate Diwali at one of London's oldest Indian restaurants</h2><p>Where better to celebrate Diwali, the festival of lights, than at one of London's oldest Indian restaurants, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Babur</a>, which was last year crowned the capital's Best Asian Restaurant? A true gem in south-east London, Babur is serving up a divine Diwali menu on Sunday 12 November consisting of three courses, with the option to add expertly picked wines. The restaurant's beautiful Rajasthani marquee will be dressed in dazzling Diwali décor and guests will dine amongst candlelight, while a Bollywood dance group will entertain and perform live.</p><p>The highlights of the set menu include a steamed sea bass with spiced coconut chutney, minced mutton kebab, and buffalo milk kheer, also known as Indian rice pudding. The £50 menu, or £65 with paired wine, will be available on the evening of 12 November for the main Diwali event, but will also run until the end of the month so there's plenty of opportunity to try it.</p><p>As someone who is a big fan of Babur and who has visited various times over the years, I can confidently say this celebration should be an evening to remember. On my most recent dine at Babur, I had the juicy and flavoursome lamb chops which are an absolute must-order, as well as the classic but everyone's favourite combo of tikka butter masala with pilau rice, peshwari naan, and dal makhni. Babur's signature special to look out for, and given the unique presentation you won't miss it, is the chicken Chettinad – black pepper chicken masala hidden under a cone-shaped rice wafer that you crack into. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4178794a3964-100wds-98.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=4178794a3964-100wds-98>Try a bottomless brunch like no other at 100 Wardour Street</h2><p><a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>100 Wardour Street</strong></a> loves its themes, with bottomless brunches ranging from Sister Act to Abba themes over the years – but their latest might be our favourite one yet!</p><p>The ‘Brunch N Grind’ brunch is all about 90s classics and R&B hits, and I loved the club vibe in there while enjoying a day out with my bestie during a classic girlie pastime.&nbsp;</p><p>We especially loved the food. While some brunches are all about the bubbles without the grub somewhat lacking, 100 Wardour Street’s gorgeous Moroccan shakshuka kept up as full as our glasses of fizz – and was very reasonably priced too!</p><p><br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fcdca2036323-la-bodega-negra.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=fcdca2036323-la-bodega-negra>Warm up at La Bodega Negra</h2><p>Going to La Bodega Negra isn’t just a restaurant, it’s an experience. For one, it’s impossible not to get confused by the entrance which is a secret that you’ll have to work out for yourself - but let’s just say that if you’re seeing confusing neon signs about peep shows, you’ve come to the right place.&nbsp;</p><p>After completing the mission of getting inside the stylish Mexican restaurant, I love the cool, moody atmosphere of the eatery as well as the sharing plates - their guacamole is second to none. But my all-time favourite thing has to be the restaurant’s range of margaritas - the spicy one in particular is delicious.

Stepping in from the cold you’ll be greeted by a Mediterranean interior to make you feel snug.</p><p>The menu at Fiume boasts an array of familiar Italian classics as well as modern twists to keep your palette on its toes. From the decadent truffle dishes to the fresh stone bass, it was hard to choose but I absolutely adored the lamb cutlets.</p><p>Partnering with cocktail wizards Italicus, there is also a host of Italian tipples to compliment your food. With a festive group menu available, it’s never too early to get Christmassy.</p><p></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/698eef985810-tapas-revolution-paella.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=698eef985810-tapas-revolution-paella>Tuck into Spanish delights at Tapas Revolution</h2><p dir=ltr><a href=# rel=nofollow>Tapas Revolution</a> in <a href=# rel=nofollow>Westfield Stratford City</a> is the perfect post-shopping pit stop. This casual eatery brings the colourful cuisine and culinary delights of Spain to London with a vibrant menu curated by critically acclaimed chef Omar Allibhoy.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>London's food scene isn't short of imaginative fusion eateries serving up flamboyant dishes and towering desserts served on mythical platters of dry ice, yet I found the simplicity of Tapas Revolution's offering incredibly refreshing - just simple, Spanish cuisine as it should be.</p><p dir=ltr>Menu highlights included the melt-in-the-mouth Jamon Iberica and pork belly croquettes, followed by the fiery Argentinian prawns served in bubbling garlic and chilli oil, and seared chorizo slices. I dove into the Arroz de Cerdo - a hearty rice dish served in a seriously rich sauce; the perfect accompaniment to a generous jug of Sangria. The restaurant's mantra is "our food is meant to be shared," but when you take a bite, you likely won't want to!</p><p dir=ltr><br></p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Best places for roast dinner in London - the ultimate Sunday lunch guide" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/5c149f671b50-roast-dinner-in-london-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Best places for roast dinner in London - the ultimate Sunday lunch guide" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Best places for roast dinner in London - the ultimate Sunday lunch guide</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="HELLO!

Located opposite Kensington Palace, it benefits from a very touristy location - but take it from someone who worked in the area for the best part of six years, this doesn’t always go hand-in-hand with quality. I was pleasantly surprised by my visit to the restaurant, however.</p><p dir=ltr>Branding itself an Italian tapas restaurant, we were advised to order three dishes per person from its wide-ranging menu, which covers all the basics from burrata to pizza and pasta. The starters were probably my favourite; crispy bruschetta laden down with punchy garlic-infused cherry tomatoes and a melt in your mouth arancini. The mains were more generously sized – a gooey, cheesy lasagne was the ultimate comfort food, and I was impressed by the mozzarella stuffed ravioli. I tried the baked aubergine as a side but wished I’d gone for something a little greener. Of course, there is always room for dessert, and we shared a delightfully creamy tiramisu.</p><p dir=ltr>As for the décor, the venue is extremely Instagram-friendly, making it the perfect spot for a cosy date night. The small room is tastefully decked out with boho lampshades, velvet lined booths, and a fairy light adorned tree with low-hanging branches for added ambience. ambience. It's worth noting that this festive season Como Garden will be serving a series of limited-edition panettones, including a pistachio and white chocolate flavour, and a rich salted caramel - so book your table now!</p><p dir=ltr><strong><br></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ccc1509cf741-0c4a5686.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=ccc1509cf741-0c4a5686>Take a tour of Asia at Sticky Mango</h2><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Sticky Mango</a>, where to start? This place is Nirvana for fans of Southeast Asian food. Known for its sophisticated dining and Instagrammable settings – think quirky vibrant art and faux cherry blossom cascading from the ceiling – Sticky Mango has just opened its newest branch in Tower Bridge. The views of the river and one of London's most iconic landmarks were enough to entice me in, but I'd also heard rave reviews about the food. And I'm pleased to say, they are all completely justified.</p><p>When my friend and I dined there, we spent a good amount of time deliberating over what to order because everything generally sounded amazing. I would have been happy with anything, it's just one of those places where you can't go wrong. You can easily take a tour of Asia with the variety of dishes, from Malaysian chicken curry puffs to Thai spiced scallops.</p><p>For our pan-Asian feast, we indulged in the crispy chicken and shrimp nam rolls which we ate wrapped in a gem lettuce leaf as per the chef's suggestion, and also the black pepper prawns, taking each bite with a chunk of sweet dehydrated pineapple, again as recommended by the chef. For mains, my absolute favourite was the miso glazed black cod, which was surprisingly meaty in texture, served on a bed of pickled daikon and cucumber salad. We also shared half of a Singapore chilli lobster which came with an innovative fried bao bun – this one's for spice lovers as it does heat up your mouth pretty quickly. Each dish was beautifully presented and the service was so warm and friendly. An 11 out of ten rating from two very happy diners.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/7699fdda13ac-officina0012102346.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=7699fdda13ac-officina0012102346>Enter pasta heaven at Officina OO</h2><p>Pasta lovers, listen up! <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Officina 00</strong></a> is the place to go if you want beautiful, freshly made pasta in the capital.&nbsp;</p><p>The Italian restaurant, which has branches in Fitzrovia and Old Street, is passionate about creating authentic, regional, and traditional dishes – like the curly pappardelle I sampled made with both meatballs and melt-in-your-mouth beef short rib ragu. My friend tried the casarecce, which looked like a bowl of gooey pistachio pesto heaven, and it certainly was.&nbsp;</p><p>We also shared the silky buffalo burrata, which was inventively served on a tomato tartare base; it was probably one of the best burratas I've had in London. Continuing with the menu's creative flair, we also tried the crunchy tiramisu, the restaurant's modern take on a classic which worked a treat.</p><p>The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming when we visited the Fitzrozia branch on a Sunday lunchtime. Given the predominantly office-based area, the restaurant wasn't exactly buzzing, but it still had a nice vibe to it. I imagine it's livelier on a weekday evening.</p><p>Officina OO also hosts pasta masterclasses at the restaurant where you can learn how to make artisanal pasta from scratch. More details about the workshops can be found on their website.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong></strong></a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ca9e5f72b7a9-bibliotheque-restaurant-london.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=ca9e5f72b7a9-bibliotheque-restaurant-london>Visit La Bibliothèque – London's new boutique restaurant with rooms</h2><p>An intimate new restaurant with rooms, La Bibliothèque is bringing a touch of luxury to the East London scene. The Haggerston venue, launched by the MAP Maison team, boasts one of the most inventive menus I've tried in a while. From the moment I stepped through the dimly-lit, security-manned door, I could tell La Bibliothèque wasn't your average venue. The newly-opened eatery is also a boutique hotel with three luxury rooms and features a snug Members Whisky Library as well as an outdoor terrace which is currently under construction. Aside from its multi-hyphenate function and sumptuous interiors, its selling point is a creative fine dining menu with Mediterranean and Japanese influences.</p><p>Delving headfirst into the beautifully presented cocktail menu to whet my appetite, I tried the 'Memories' concoction. It was comprised of Japanese gin and sparkling sake with yuzu sorbet floating in the glass, which was a surprising treat for the palette as the ice melted into the drink. You have to order the Milk Bread, designed by Sous Chef James O'Malley. Every table around me was also feasting on the mouthwatering brioche-style bun, accompanied by the most delightful butters featuring whipped brown miso, toasted sesame, and crispy shallot flavours.</p><p>Onto the starters; the scallop with prosciutto, apple and wasabi was my personal highlight and melt-in-your-mouth delicious with a spicy kick. The duck breast followed, served three ways and with a rich, flavoursome plum sauce served with kabu and shiso. The staff all recommended the chestnut with pear and Madeira ice cream dessert and they weren't wrong – the autumnal flavours were the perfect way to round off the meal.

Overlooking the River Thames, the five-star Westin Hotel's restaurant and wine bar is both unassuming and seriously luxe. With it's cosy art-deco style interiors and floor-to-ceiling windows with unparalleled views of the cityscape, you'll have the most beautiful backdrop as the sun goes down.&nbsp;</p><p>On offer is a collection of over 80 premium wines, all designed to be paired with delicious small plates. Hithe refers to the 'old world', with options from locations like France, Germany and Spain, while Seek is all about 'new world' wine producers. Think New Zealand, Lebanon and Slovenia. Prefer a cocktail? There's also an extensive menu of playful twists on the classics.</p><p>Certainly not an afterthought, the food is incredible. We enjoyed Braised Mangalitza Pork Belly Bao Buns, Lobster Roll with Tarragon, Pickles & Tout Roe, and Tuna Tartare Tacos with Avocado Purée, Chives & Finger Lime - to name just a few. You'll struggle to not order at least one of everything on the menu.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/c25d483a4971-sushi-n-sticks.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=c25d483a4971-sushi-n-sticks>Enjoy an Asian feast at Sticks'n'Sushi</h2><p>If I had to only live on one cuisine, it would definitely be Japanese. So when I was offered the chance to review the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Sticks'n'Sushi</strong></a> branch in Victoria, I didn't think twice. But what's so fantastic about the upmarket chain, which was created by Danish-Japanese brothers, is that Sticks'n'Sushi is more than just your regular sushi, sashimi, maki, and tempura.</p><p>I've been to Sticks'n'Sushi once before and my main takeaway was that the food was sublime, if not a little pricey. This time around, my friend and I opted to share one of the set menus, and I would definitely recommend doing this to get the most bang for your buck. Plus, the a la carte menu is a little overwhelming with almost too much choice. You could spend hours just deliberating.</p><p>All the set menus looked divine, but we ended up going for the Carpe Diem. First of all, it was a lot of food for the two of us, so much so that we had to forego dessert, although they looked equally delicious. Beautiful platter after beautiful platter came out. There was so much variety there was no chance of us getting bored. The highlights for us were the silky salmon carpaccio, the moreish crab croquettes, and the tempura shrimp and avocado sushi rolls. As for the 'sticks' part of the set menu, the scallops and bacon sticks were by far the best. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong></strong></a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e7911c4ec259-restaurant.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=e7911c4ec259-restaurant>Attend the eternal Christmas ball at German Gymnasium</h2><p>Standing with pride in the beating heart of King's Cross is <a href=# rel=nofollow>German Gymnasium</a> - A multi storied treasure trove of tradition and opulence, boasting one of London's largest Christmas trees and dazzling lights to boot.&nbsp;</p><p>The grade II listed building always makes the perfect location for a jaw dropping cocktail setting, but the Christmas angels’ wand waving has taken the interior to the next level.</p><p>Get transported into a traditional European setting, each table boasting a view of the gorgeous Grand Café - The huge hall with warm lighting and its smooth wooden interior still gives cosy vibes for a cocktail or dinner.

A treat for Pilates enthusiasts, London's Nobu Hotel has a lavish new offering combining wholesome Pilates with a ritzy dining experience in their stunning Portman Square restaurant.</p><p>As a fan of both Pilates and Japanese cuisine, I jumped at the opportunity to spend my afternoon indulging in both. The class, led by Nobu Pilates Founder, Marsha Lindsay, provided a next level ab and glute burn as we were guided through a series of exercises on the Reformer carriage. The studio is a total zen den too, with immaculate equipment and natural light providing a calming workout space.</p><p>Available Monday to Saturday lunchtimes and afternoons, choose from one of the three signature Nobu Pilates classes; Power, Precision and Pure, followed by a delicious Bento Box and non-alcoholic cocktail in the London hotspot Nobu London Portman Square restaurant. <a href=# rel=nofollow>Prices from £90pp.</a>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/10384b4f8a5a-lio-london-show.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=10384b4f8a5a-lio-london-show>Dance the night away at Lío London</h2><p dir=ltr>If you're looking for an amazing night in London, this is where you have to go. Having recently arrived in the capital, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Lío</a> is a global phenomenon that delivers high octane cabaret for the 21st Century.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>You'll want to get dressed up (I wore a very sparkly sequin dress for the occasion!) and revel in the entertainment and the delicious food. The fully immersive experience combines a Mediterranean inspired menu with extraordinary acts and world class performers from dance, theatre, erotica, and acrobatics to create the pinnacle of theatrical dining. Trust me: some of the acts will have your jaw on the floor!</p><p dir=ltr>The season’s world class troupe of performers will have your heart racing, and be sure to get out of your seat to dance. After dinner on Fridays and Saturdays, the main room transforms into a club for diners to continue the party. By far one of my favourite London nights out.</p><p dir=ltr></p><h2>Best activities to do in London in November</h2><p id=e166E4IPZn data-wc=14></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/19c472c0e6f2-gd-prvw-280-credit-manuel-harlan.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=19c472c0e6f2-gd-prvw-280-credit-manuel-harlan>Get transported to 1950's Manhattan at the Bridge</h2><p dir=ltr>With its breathtaking views out over Tower Bridge, and the beautifully designed &nbsp;interior, the bar at the Bridge might have justified grounds to declare themselves as the best theatre bar in London.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>But that’s not the reason I was there. Once my friends and I had taken our fill of the view and finished our drinks, we descended the sweeping staircase into the theatre itself and found we’d landed directly in the bustle of New York. The theatre has been transformed into the streets of 1950’s Manhattan, complete with neon signs glowing overhead, the honking of car horns, and pretzel vendors milling with the audience. This is <a href=# rel=nofollow>Guys & Dolls</a>, but as you’ve never seen it before.</p><p dir=ltr>We passed through the rows of seats and headed straight down into the action. For those who think even the front row isn’t close enough, the seats have been taken out of the stalls, leaving an immersive space for audience members to stand right up close. Costumed cops prowl around and keep us in line as the stage rises and falls right in front of our eyes.</p><p dir=ltr>In my opinion, this classic Broadway tale of crapshooters, missionaries and showgirls has never looked (or sounded) so good. A fantastic night out for both die hard fans of the musical, and those after something a little bit different.</p><p dir=ltr></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f6e51d12c156-elizabeth-scarlet.png><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=f6e51d12c156-elizabeth-scarlet>Visit the festive Elizabeth Scarlett pop up</h2><p><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.elizabethscarlett.com/&source=gmail&ust=1701334701492000&usg=AOvVaw2Biz2_bnw4YhNRL_-yXEmJ" href=# rel=nofollow>Elizabeth Scarlett</a> have opened an exclusive pop-up in Fortnum and Mason, running throughout November and December.

But when you get a gang together who are all absolutely shameless with singing their tunes, it can be an absolute tip top night - and that is how I would describe the night I had with my friends at Lucky Voice to enjoy some Christmassy tunes to get into the spirit as the nights got darker.&nbsp;</p><p>As an 'activity' kind of night in London, with their wide range of tunes and excellent service of continuous Prosecco, you couldn’t do much better!

It’s not all patriotism though, as it also gives a stark reminder of some of the horrors the players faced, including social media abuse and racism, while shedding light on the intense pressure felt when the hopes of millions are resting on your shoulders.

I couldn't help but catch myself being amazed by Henry’s very well-done vanishing acts as he travels through time - stage magic!&nbsp;</p><p>was a particularly excellent number that may or may not be showing up on my Spotify Unwrapped playlist.
