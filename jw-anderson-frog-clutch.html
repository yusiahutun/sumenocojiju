Stand-up comedians won’t get a laugh unless they’ve fully committed to a bit, runners won’t finish a marathon unless they’ve committed to training, and you’ll never win a costume contest unless you’ve gone above and beyond to commit to the theme. The same sentiment rings true when it comes to fashion. An obscure (and weirdly realistic) frog clutch wouldn’t be the “it bag” of the season if JW Anderson hadn’t already proved his commitment to a quirky animal theme. It started with the obscure viral pigeon bag and now, the new <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">JW Anderson frog clutch</a> is leaping into viral fashion fame. Care to hop along?&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re late to the fashion menagerie, let me fly you up to speed. Last year, JW Anderson designed a pigeon bag that would have any passerby convinced you were carrying around a live bird—it was that realistic. The bird first made an appearance in the JW Anderson Men’s Fall 2022 Collection<strong> </strong>and was put into production after an enthusiastic reaction.&nbsp;</p><p>The pigeon bag is true-to-size and conveniently hinges open at the wing for a practical storage solution. Unsurprisingly, the pigeon bag quickly went viral on social media and migrated from its comedic fashion association into <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a coveted luxury good.</a></p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-1.5><h2>Sarah Jessica Parker on set for And Just Like That...</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1430793309-1.jpg><p>Pigeon bag skeptics flew the coup once they saw Sarah Jessica Parker carrying the funny little clutch around New York City while filming an episode for season two of And Just Like That.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.280487804878><h2>JW Anderson Pigeon Clutch Bag</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-21-at-11.13.27-AM.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The pigeon bag</a> is 3-D printed and retails for almost $900. While there was once a waitlist for the clutch, you can now order and get almost-immediate satisfaction with rush shipping.</p><p>If you have an aversion to birds, you may find amphibians more appealing. JW Anderson made the marsh the backdrop for its latest collection of frog accessories.&nbsp;</p><p>A few months ago, the JW Anderson frog shoes started popping up online and while I admit to finding them ugly at first, I eventually found the little rubber guys endearing. The webbed-toe look is thanks to a collaboration between JW Anderson and Wellipets, a brand that specializes in rain boots.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-1.0259433962264><h2>JW Anderson x Wellipets Frog Loafers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1499738439.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The frog effect</a> was confirmed when <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>the shoes</a> started hopping around street-style photos during the latest men’s fashion week.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.6697986577181><h2>JW Anderson Small Frog Clutch Bag</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/frog-clutch-4.webp?w=503"><p>Now, JW Anderson has landed his life-like creations with<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> a frog clutch</a> (which is designed to look as if it’s literally clutching your arm).
