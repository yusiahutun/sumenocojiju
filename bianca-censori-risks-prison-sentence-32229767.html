The architect, 29, left her entire groin and bum exposed in a pair of sheer tights, slipping into a cropped blue top that appeared completely see-through and left her nipples on display. That outfit was followed by Bianca adding a fur coat with text stencilled into the back worn over her tights."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Article 222-32 of the penal code from March 1994 states: “Deliberate sexual display in the sight of others in a place accessible to the public gaze is punishable by one year in prison and a fine of one hundred thousand francs.”</p><p><b>READ MORE: <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Paulina Porizkova, 58, wows in satin lingerie as she shows off hip replacement result</a></b></p><p><b>READ MORE:</b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#> <b>Want more showbiz?

But nudity itself isn’t equivalent to indecency, and the law further adds: “The charge has been worded in such a way as to rule out any possibility of proceedings against persons practising naturism in places specially designated for this purpose.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32229856.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_PAY-PREMIUM-EXCLUSIVE-MUST-CALL-FOR-PRICING-BEFORE-USAGE-Kanye-West-and-Bianca-Censori-do-some-shop.jpg><p>The couple previously risked a hefty fine while strolling “virtually naked” around Italy.

Though there’s no official dress code in the country, tourists are advised to wear clothes that cover both shoulders and knees, and to avoid anything too tight – and Bianca was breaking all three unspoken rules.</p>Get your Skims lounge dress dupes <a class=affiliate-title href=# rel=nofollow>Fitted long strappy dress</a> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30778123.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_bershkaJPG.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>The low effort, high reward fitted dress has a scoop neck design with adjustable strap.

Bianca scraped her dark hair back in a wet-look style and wore minimal make-up for the outing, swiping on a glossy pink lip and just a hint of pink eyeshadow. She headed out to browse the Balenciaga store with Kanye, chatting to a shop worker as they explored what the fashion house had to offer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30778123.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_bershkaJPG.jpg><p><b>For more of the latest showbiz news from Daily Star, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters </b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#><b>here.</b></a></p><p>Bianca appears to be following Kanye’s “no pants this year” rule that he set out on Instagram, with sources claiming to the Daily Mail: “Kanye has a set of rules for Bianca, which includes never speak and wear what he wants her to wear.
