This comes with some positives and negatives. The main downside is, a Pico isn't going to be as powerful as its big brothers. A Raspberry Pi 4 boasts a 1.5GHz quad-core processor and up to 8GB of RAM---while the Pico clocks in at <a href=#>133MHz and sports 256KB of RAM</a>. But the Pico has some significant upsides, the main two being its tiny size and the fact you can pick one up for $4.</p><p>While the Pico's lack of power might make it seem limited compared to the rest of the Raspberry Pi family, it is still capable of becoming the core component of several fun projects. In some cases, like with drone building, the Pico's lack of weight makes it far more suitable than any other Pi.</p><p>To help get the most out of the hardware, microcontrollers like the Pico have their own stripped-down and <a href=#>efficient version of Python 3</a>, called MicroPython. However, experienced Python users shouldn't worry; MicroPython is cross-compatible, and in a lot of cases, code from regular Python can be transferred with ease.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fun-and-games>Fun and Games</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/623b0fda.jpg> Robin Grosset<p>Using any version of the Pi to create something is rewarding and fun. But the fun doesn't have to stop when the project is complete. The Pico can emulate older video game systems, several visual games, and even cutting-edge toys for the family pet despite its limitations. These projects aren't easy, but their creators have provided guides anyone can follow, and if you make it to the end, you have something you can enjoy for a long time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>8-Bit Emulator:</strong>&nbsp;YouTuber Robin Grosset has used a Pico as the basis for a <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">BBC Micro emulator</a>.

However, if you want to be more hands-on with your smart home, a Pi Pico may be the way to go. You can use it to control some existing devices or even create a new device from scratch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow"><strong>Control Your Lights</strong></a>: Yes, tons of smart bulbs work seamlessly with most major smart home apps, but those are a bit too easy to use with their finely polished apps and general functionality. If you want to go hardcore with home automation and make your own light controller, Youtuber&nbsp;Nikunj Panchal has a guide on using a Pico to control a set of smart bulbs.</li><li><a href=#><strong>Thermometer and Humidity Sensor</strong></a>: Have you ever felt a little too hot and humid or cold and dry? Completing this fun little project can help you scientifically confirm those suspicions.</li><li><strong><a href=#>Automatic Fan</a></strong>: For the hot and humid folks above who need a break, you can code a Pico to control a fan. It can turn the fan on at a specific temperature and increase the fan speed as the mercury rises.</li><li><a href=#><strong>Sous Vide Setup</strong></a>: There's cooking food from scratch, then there's cooking from a point where you're designing and building your own equipment. A Pi Pico can form the basis of your entry point <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">into the world of sous vide</a>. For those who don't know, that's a cooking method that involves boiling something in a bag at a set temperature before finishing it off in an oven or pan.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=build-a-robot>Build a Robot</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/88359bc4.png> <a href=#>Paolo De Gasperis/Shutterstock.com</a><p>If you watched <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Battle Bots1</a> or its infinitely superior British cousin <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Robot Wars</a> as a kid, you might have dreamed of building your own little death machine one of these days. While none of the following robots have chainsaws or flamethrowers attached, they are all an excellent way to get to grips with amateur robotics. And hey---you can always attach a chainsaw tape a butter knife to one of them if you want to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><a href=#><strong>Simple Robot</strong></a>: This robot has three wheels and a (limited) mind of its own.

It is a great entry point into robot building, and you'll learn a lot about the mechanics of it all and the basic code required.</li><li><a href=#>Remote Controlled Car</a>: The remote-controlled car project is a little more advanced on paper, but the parts come in a kit and with a <a href=#>detailed guide</a>.</li><li><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">More Advanced Bot</a>: Hash Robotics has a tutorial on building a more advanced robot that can spot and react to various obstacles.
