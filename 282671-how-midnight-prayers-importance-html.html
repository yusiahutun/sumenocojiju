Listen to God</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d349cd5654a5c050.jpeg><p class=align-left>God will hear your pleas for mercy, grace, and blessings but, how often do you stop and listen to Him first? Through reading and meditating on the scripture, you will be able to know what God wants and expects. Also, you will learn about all the promises God made for his children. In fact, you can reference some prayers made in the Bible by great men and women including Daniel (Daniel 9: 1-19) and Hannah (1 Samuel 2:1-20).</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0101dae3359bd0ed.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 prayers before reading the Bible, Bible study, or scripture</span></p></a><h3><strong>2. Evaluate yourself</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2f8ddcff1481d034.jpg><p class=align-left>With the knowledge of God words, search your heart and mind and see if there is something you have done that is not pleasing and repent. John 5:17 urges Christians to keep God’s word at heart so that when you ask for anything via prayer, you may receive it. When praying, you should get rid of all destruction including the mental and physical barriers.</p><h3><strong>3. Thank God</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs6tnvgd2tpfg.jpg><p class=align-left>The best way to start a prayer is by acknowledging what God has already done for you. Do not primarily focus on material benefits or blessings. Instead, thank God for the gifts of joy, patience, peace, and grace. Remind yourself how He has walked with you throughout your life and thank Him for his goodness.</p><h3><strong>4. Express your desires with emotions</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0101dae3359bd0ed.jpg><p class=align-left>Do not be afraid to tell God how you feel. In Psalms 141, David cries out to the Lord to shield him from his enemies and temptations. Similarly, Daniel pleaded with God in prayer to turn away His wrath from Jerusalem. While you do this, acknowledge the nature of God as Daniel did in Daniel 9:18.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/54befd88cac5756b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 short morning prayers for friends to bless their day</span></p></a><h3><strong>5. Ask with faith</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs65m5gjkrj5e.jpg><p class=align-left>When offering midnight prayers for a breakthrough, make sure you ask for what you need. Matthew 7:7 and James 4:2 reminds Christians that you lack because you fail to ask.</p><h3><strong>6. Keep in mind God’s will and timing</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs2hsm63qb45d.jpg><p class=align-left>Maybe, your breakthrough has not happened because it is not in line with God’s word. In other cases, your breakthrough is dependent on God’s timing. Therefore, when you ask according to God’s purpose in your life, He will surely answer (1 John 5:14).</p><h3><strong>7. Demonstrate your seriousness</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Even after asking, show God how much you need the breakthrough. You can do this by emulating Daniel who committed to fast for 21 days and practiced spiritual discipline. Better yet, you can present the same issue to God each day until He answers.</p><h3><strong>8. Testify of God’s goodness</strong></h3><p class=align-left>When you receive an answer, give thanks and testify to others what God has done for you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5a182d8dbe7ae80e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15+ powerful good morning prayers for him to wake up to</span></p></a><h3><strong>9. Continue seeking God</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs7h3t6gg70n9.jpg><p class=align-left>Prayer does not stop at the breakthrough. Make seeking God part and parcel of your daily life. The Bible encourages Christians to prioritize the Kingdom of God then you shall receive all you need (Luke 12:31). Also, Hebrews 11:6 reminds believers that God rewards those who seek Him tirelessly.</p><h2>The effectiveness of midnight prayers</h2><p class=align-left>Prayers offered to God at any time including midnight will work. Paul and Silas serve as an example of brethren who received their breakthrough because of midnight prayers. As a believer, it is your understanding of God that primarily shapes your prayers life and the likelihood of success (breakthrough). So, if you see God as a father you can be able to take your pleas, and petitions before Him confidently. But if you misunderstand the nature of God, prayer becomes but a duty or standard procedure.</p><h2>Scriptures on midnight prayers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/54befd88cac5756b.jpg><p class=align-left>Apart from Acts 16:24-35 here are some verses that speak about midnight prayers.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5a182d8dbe7ae80e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 strong opening prayer points for church service, Sunday, or worship</span></p></a><ul><li>Psalms 119: 62</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs4ogchqaelud.jpg><p class=align-left>The Psalmist states that he will wake up at midnight to give thanks to the Lord.</p><ul><li>Lamentations 2:19</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs7b7brhvmpl.jpg><p class=align-left>The verse encourages believers to wake up at night and pour out their Heart to God.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5a182d8dbe7ae80e.jpg><p class=align-left>Even though this verse does not primarily talk about midnight, it shows us how Jesus led by example when he went to the mountain to pray all night.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs1ol9s3kei0f8.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: These 5 prayers help you to heal your emotions</strong></p><p class=align-left>While you offer midnight prayers, always remember God’s promises and his nature.
