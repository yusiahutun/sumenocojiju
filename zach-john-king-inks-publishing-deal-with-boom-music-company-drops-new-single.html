In addition to his signing with Boom, the Georgia (GA) native announces the release of his new single, “Anything But What It Was,” today (January 19).</p><p>Hailing from Fayetteville, King grew up listening to Country music and established his passion for songwriting early on. With his strong songwriting foundation, the Country newcomer’s artist career continues to take off quickly.</p><p>“I’m incredibly grateful to be a part of such a powerhouse team,” said King. “I don’t take this opportunity lightly and am so stoked to start working. I can’t wait to learn and grow in this new family of incredible writers, people, and professionals. Here’s to the future!”</p><p>Written by <strong>Jessica Faren, King, Jacob Lutz,</strong> and<strong> Tom Whall</strong> and produced by <strong>Whall</strong> and<strong> Ryan Wilson</strong>, “Anything But What It Was” is King’s highly anticipated release following his first two debut singles, “Just Missed You” and “Same Song, Different Dance,” which garnered 1.5M global streams.</p><p>King’s recent releases earned him features on playlists, including Apple Music’s “New In Country” and “Country Risers,” Spotify’s “New Music Friday Country” and “Fresh Finds Country,” TIDAL’s “Country Airwaves” and “Country Waves,” ACM, CMT, Whiskey Riff and more. His newly released single brings a fresh new take to his popular catalog, highlighting his real-life tribulations with love lost.</p><p>“This is one of the most honest songs I’ve ever written,” shares King. “It’s about a real conversation I had with somebody I loved, and we realized that I was going one way in life and she was going another. It’s about breaking up with someone without making them an enemy. Ending a relationship isn’t always black and white; most times, that’s why it’s so hard to do.”</p><p>“I was so impressed by Zach’s work ethic and attitude from our first meeting,” shared <strong>Boom’s Vice President Shaina Botwin</strong>. “Once I heard the music he was writing, I knew we had to work together. I’m incredibly excited to welcome Zach into the Boom family and can’t wait for everyone to hear what he’s been working on!”</p><p>Re-launched in 2021 by Joe Fisher and Botwin, Boom Music Group’s team looks forward to supporting King as their newest signee, adding to their growing roster of <strong>James Barker, Micah Carpenter, Rodney Clawson, Billy Dawson, Jacob Hackworth, Erin Kinsey, Jimmy Robbins</strong> and<strong> Chris Tompkins</strong> and securing hits with Country’s biggest names, including over 150 cuts in 2023 alone.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4FwfJBoaHJnqpawqXnJqJ%2BnZZueu6h5yKeirGWgqq%2BttdKhoKefXZmyoriMsKCtoF2XvLC5jKasrKGTYrCwuc%2BapbJllKe8sb%2BMp5ywZaOeu6i4xGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
