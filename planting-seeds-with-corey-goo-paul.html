Paul still composts with fish but has added kitchen and yard scraps to his gardening efforts as well.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/03/One-of-Goos-children-with-flowers-from-the-family-garden.-Photo-courtesy-of-Goo-768x1024.jpg><p class=p3><span class=s2>As his cultivating abilities grew, so did his fan base. At the Fort Pierce Housing Authority, where Paul has been employed for 17 years and currently serves as a Section 8 housing inspector, he often shares the fruits of his labors with colleagues who request his homegrown collard greens and San Marzano tomatoes. He is also imparting his gardening wisdom to his eight children, who help care for the raised beds behind the family home in Fort Pierce. “Every household should have a garden,” says Paul. “Besides putting food on the table, it’s therapeutic and teaches patience.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>To broaden his reach, Paul became a presence on social media, where he posts entertaining (and often hilarious) videos about gardening and sustainable living on YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram. In the videos, which he shoots in his home garden, he shares advice on topics ranging from planting, growing, and harvesting to preparing produce that is nourishing and stretches the budget—and he makes it fun.</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s4>With an infectious smile, Paul raps about the benefits of growing your own food with lyrics like:</span><span class=s2><i>“If you grow your own food, how could you lose, you dig? Put them seeds in the ground, yo, then I watch them grow….”</i></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/03/Teaching-students-at-White-City-Elementary-School.-Photo-courtesy-of-Goo.jpg><p class=p3><span class=s2>Young people are enamored with Paul and his positive messages about living sustainably. Since launching “<a href=# rel=noopener>Gardening with Goo</a>” in 2019, the YouTube channel has amassed nearly </span>25,000 subscribers; on TikTok, he has nearly 300,000 followers,<span class=s2> and his videos have accumulated around 2 million likes to date. “Kids get so excited when I show them how easy it is to plant things like Swiss chard and collard greens,” Paul says. “Even if you’re not partial to vegetables, growing something from seed makes it taste more delicious because it was raised with love.”</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>Paul notes that gardening promotes not only positivity but </span>also a sense of pride in kids, while doing something fun. Locally, <span class=s2>he tries to share his passion with as many kids as possible—on Fridays, he volunteers at White City Elementary School in Fort Pierce, where he and Port St. Lucie’s Families of the Treasure Coast erected a community garden this past January for the schoolchildren to enjoy.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tMDUmqmtpZGcrru1zZ5lnKedZMC1wcCrq2akmZuycLvUrZuop6KofLG4wKeroqaXYsCmscOsZLChpJ16pLvRnrBmn5%2BkerGt1KVm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
