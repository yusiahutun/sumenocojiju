Which is, people who have nothing to prove with what they wear.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Who is Everything Everywhere All at Once’s costume designer, Shirley Kurata?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In the case of the Roys it is blood lineage directly to the money, right? They were born affluent. They’ve only ever known that. And so for them, the posture of wealth doesn’t really mean all that much,” she told Vogue Australia. “They are not attempting to have affectation in what they wear, as we see in Logan and [his children]. Although they obviously have extremely expensive tastes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/06/734ca5fb-fd19-476e-af00-7ab3043fe3af_316c7935.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It isn’t for anyone else, or anyone else’s knowledge, that they do it. They know nothing else. But they are not posturing their money … they’ve got nothing to prove.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This is why Logan Roy, the family patriarch, is often seen in grey shawl cardigans – when not in bespoke suits by the famed Savile Row tailor Leonard Logsdail – and on the flipside, why Shiv Roy’s striving husband Tom Wambsgans sports clothes that are a touch too flashy. Or indeed puffy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In one episode, Tom memorably wears an expensive Moncler puffer vest and the youngest and naughtiest Roy child, Roman, asks him if he has stuffed it with his “hopes and dreams”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/06/3bca8bb6-b7e7-41ab-91a5-0b04aebfef23_41c2e6fd.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Luckily it’s not only morally questionable fictional billionaires (and those willing to queue for five hours on the chance there might be something left in The Row sale) who can tap into the stealth wealth aesthetic. What’s more, with the spectre of another financial recession potentially looming, a return to quiet luxury, logo-free dressing and pieces designed to be worn forever may well be the direction that fashion is shifting. Essential elegance is making a comeback.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Will Bernard Arnault’s son Antoine succeed his billionaire dad at LVMH?</span></p></a></h3>“‘Plain luxury’ is a trend we have identified for spring/summer 2023,” says Libby Page, market director at online luxury retailer Net-a-Porter. “After several seasons of embracing joyful dressing, this mood marks the reinstatement of simplicity and everyday dressing to our wardrobes. We have always acknowledged the presence of fashion foundations throughout previous seasons, however, the mood truly commanded <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">the spring/summer runway</span></a>, proving pared-back elegance is the height of luxury.”<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/06/7d1ebc2b-8983-4d40-87a7-78159399a42a_c43c446c.jpg>And the evidence is easily found in a slew of designers offering their own take on pared-back aesthetics today. Page points at Bottega Veneta’s creative director Matthieu Blazy, who stressed the brand is a destination for “elevated essentials”. “The seemingly understated print leather shirt, displayed <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">by Kate Moss</span></a>, was anything but, requiring 12 layers of print to achieve the exact colour he was looking for – the epitome of understated elegance,” adds Page.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The Row makes simple wardrobe foundations feel luxurious and unique. The floor-length white duster coat paired with simple cotton shorts and the summer suiting were both highlights. Valentino’s neutral colour palette was a stark contrast to the bright fuchsia that has reigned supreme across red carpets since last season, and Maximilian Davis’ debut for Ferragamo was refined and high impact,” she added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/06/90e7357c-6dea-4be7-af18-3f5e035c10f6_2fcfc93c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So how do you make this look your own? Page believes that when it comes to pulling off covert luxury it’s all in the little details, including unexpected accessories and investment timepieces.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">6 of Shu Qi’s biggest luxury brand endorsements over the years</span></p></a></h3>“Style your outfit with accessories such as wrist-length gloves, ruched socks with simple plimsolls, the sleekest black flip-flop from The Row, or Loewe’s pared-back logo tote,” she says. “Finally, the ultimate investment – whether it’s a Cartier, IWC or Hermès timepiece – <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">a fine watch will add instant polish</span></a> to any look.”<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Naturally, only fellow connoisseurs will truly appreciate these rare, elusive and exclusive touches.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/06/5f57a18b-0c58-47ea-89e2-9ea6c5f2893d_41c2e6fd.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is considered very chic to dress in an understated and luxurious way. At brands such as The Row, Hermès and Loro Piana, everything is made with the best craftsmanship and most luxurious materials, yet nothing is branded. It is a thing of ‘if you know you know’ that shows more wealth than simply flaunting it,” says Tiffany Hsu, Mytheresa’s vice-president of womenswear and kidswear fashion buying.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1eav71q e1haapfp2">They are not posturing their money … they’ve got nothing to proveMichelle Matland, costume designer, Succession</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As for what not to do when it comes to stealth wealth dressing, Hsu naturally advises against overstatement. But don’t be too plain either – there’s still plenty of opportunity for self-expression.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Anything that is overly branded should be avoided,” she stresses. “The cuts and details are what really matters – these can be timeless but never generic. And if you are wearing jewellery it is never loud but kept simple and slightly hidden. Styling is kept classic with clean silhouettes, a minimal use of accessories, and no visible logos or recognisable patterns.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/06/c686aeff-ded8-440a-96af-ddcb61cefe2b_6e347bee.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The aesthetic works as well for men too. Indeed Thom Scherdel, menswear category manager at Browns Fashion, says it’s a major growing category for the retailer.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">How to rock balletcore fashion like Blackpink’s Jennie</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“For menswear, this area of understated luxury is one of our fastest-growing departments, underpinned by the finest Italian craftsmanship,” he says. “It’s a subtle and timeless approach to dressing yourself where the wearer is confident that the only person that needs to know the brand is themselves, and others that are in the know of course.”</p>Brands for men to have on their radar, says Scherdel, include the likes of Brunello Cucinelli, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Tom Ford</span></a>, Brioni, Kiton, Zegna, Lemaire and Holzweiler.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/06/a74bdd53-af04-4864-92df-0152dd757e95_a4baee9a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As for how to wear the look, Holly Tenser, Browns Fashion womenswear buying manager, says it’s about investing in classic, well-made pieces that will remain timeless, no matter how many times you turn to them. Oh, and a great coat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think the key to this aesthetic is having a great neutral-coloured coat paired with bold accessories or beautiful jewellery that can instantly elevate a casual outfit. For those who still want more of a glamorous feel, shoes are always a great investment to keep an outfit more on trend,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ultimately though, as Scherdel points out, there’s one essential factor in pulling off stealth wealth dressing: not caring how people perceive you.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The secret to stealth wealth dressing is to impress nobody but yourself,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If in doubt just ask Logan Roy.
