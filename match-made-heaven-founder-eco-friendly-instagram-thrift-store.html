“I called my boyfriend and talked for half an hour non-stop about my ideas,” said the Hongkonger, recalling the first moments when her idea for a thrift shop was coming into shape."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Some people like to buy these second-hand clothes at a cheap price and resell them for a profit. The trend has gained popularity overseas because it is cheaper and less wasteful than buying new clothes from a store. But it has yet to become widespread in Hong Kong.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Chan started with buying about 20 pieces of clothing on Carousell, an online platform for selling second-hand items. After two months of preparation, which included coming up with the brand name and designing the logo, she proudly announced the launch of her Instagram thrift store, Asian Angel, in March last year.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><a href=# title data-entity-uuid=b380da30-5ec5-11eb-9099-aaa38b7b3943 data-entity-type=node data-entity-bundle=article class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><strong type=strong><span type=text>The best vintage and secondhand shopping tips from a thrifting addict</span></strong></a></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>“It took me one week alone to come up with the shop name,” she said.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>The name Asian Angel combines her heritage with an element she sees a lot in her favourite Western clothing designs. She said her taste was inspired by the “Asian Baby Girl” look, which refers to the style of some Asian-American girls, who wear clothes and make-up that is typically bolder and showier than what is common in Hong Kong.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>The final-year journalism student at a local university is one of many entrepreneurial Hong Kong teens who start businesses on social media so they can avoid paying hefty rents.
