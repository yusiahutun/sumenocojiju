Some are about getting away from family, while others are about spending time with family. There may not be a topic in country music as simple and complex as fishing. Each of the 10 songs on this Top Fishing Songs list prove that there is much more to it than just dropping a line in the water.</p><ul><li><figure class=img-tag><p><span class=visually-hidden>Black River Music Group</span></p>Black River Music Group<p>loading...</p></figure><span class=count>10</span><h2>'Fish Weren't Bitin'</h2>Craig Morgan<p>While never released as a single,<a href=#> Craig Morgan</a>'s love-on-the-lake song from 2012 is as sweet as it is fun. There's a nice little catch at the end of this track. Morgan is the perfect man to sing it.</p></li><li><figure class=img-tag><p><span class=visually-hidden>Capitol Nashville</span></p>Capitol Nashville<p>loading...</p></figure><span class=count>9</span><h2>'If the Fish Don't Bite'</h2>Eric Paslay<p><a href=#>Eric Paslay</a>'s song about a bad day fishing is another catchy love song. While similar in theme to Morgan's, this track is a little more catchy. The 2012 single wasn't a big radio hit either, but it's a ton of fun to listen to.</p></li><li><figure class=img-tag><p><span class=visually-hidden>Valory Music Co.</span></p>Valory Music Co.<p>loading...</p></figure><span class=count>7</span><h2>'Bait a Hook'</h2>Justin Moore<p><a href=#>Justin Moore</a>'s Top 20 hit from 2011 is a guy's guy kind of song. The Arkansas native puts his unique sense of humor to this lyric about his ex's new boyfriend, a guy who's a little too hip for his tastes. This is more of a fishing lifestyle song than an out-on-the-water story, but it's catchy enough to make this list of the best fishing songs.</p></li><li><figure class=img-tag><p><span class=visually-hidden>Arista Nashville</span></p>Arista Nashville<p>loading...</p></figure><span class=count>8</span><h2>'Catch All the Fish'</h2>Brad Paisley<p><a href=#>Brad Paisley</a> is the only artist with two songs on this list. 'Catch All the Fish' is cut from his 2009 'American Saturday Night' album. "Gonna catch all the fish, gonna drink all the beer /&nbsp;Better warn her now, better make it clear /&nbsp;Might take all day, might take all year /&nbsp;Till we catch all the fish, till we drink all the beer," he sings. Hard to find a better fishing line than that.</p></li><li><figure class=img-tag><p><span class=visually-hidden>Mercury Nashville</span></p>Mercury Nashville<p>loading...</p></figure><span class=count>6</span><h2>'Bad Day of Fishin''</h2>Billy Currington<p><a href=#>Billy Currington</a> tells this story with the same ease he displays in all of his biggest hits. 'Bad Day of Fishin'' is found on the 2010 'Enjoy Yourself' album. "A bad day of fishin' beats a good day of anything else," he sings. Tough to argue with that.</p></li><li><figure class=img-tag><p><span class=visually-hidden>Bigger Picture Promotion</span></p>Bigger Picture Promotion<p>loading...</p></figure><span class=count>5</span><h2>'Fish'</h2>Craig Campbell<p>Maybe it's a little sophomoric, but <a href=#>Craig Campbell</a>'s 2011 hit is also hilarious. Great fishing songs shouldn't be too serious, and with the exception of one on this list, they aren't. This Top 30 hit for Campbell is one of the best parts of his live show.</p></li><li><figure class=img-tag><p><span class=visually-hidden>Sugar Hill Records</span></p>Sugar Hill Records<p>loading...</p></figure><span class=count>4</span><h2>'Five Pound Bass'</h2>Robert Earl Keen<p>Robert Earl Keen's song from 1989 is a straight-forward, no metaphor needed fishing song. The singer is out to catch the elusive five pound bass, and that's exactly what he does. OK, this description doesn't sound like much fun, but those who know the song well will agree it deserves a high ranking on this list of fishing songs.</p></li><li><figure class=img-tag><p><span class=visually-hidden>Sony Music Nashville</span></p>Sony Music Nashville<p>loading...</p></figure><span class=count>3</span><h2>'I'm Gonna Miss Her'</h2><p>Seriously, who would trade the love of a good woman for a morning on the lake? OK, don't answer that. Brad Paisley's breakout song was this hit from 2002. Ironically, it's also the song that he used to meet his future wife. 'I'm Gonna Miss Her' has remained a radio staple since its release over a decade ago.</p></li><li><figure class=img-tag><p><span class=visually-hidden>Show Dog Universal</span></p>Show Dog Universal<p>loading...</p></figure><span class=count>2</span><h2>'Just Fishin''</h2>Trace Adkins<p>This is the weeper on the 10 Best Fishing Songs list. <a href=#>Trace Adkins</a>' 'Just Fishin'' from 2011 is a tender ballad about a dad spending time with his daughter. She thinks they're "just fishin'," but papa Adkins knows this is a moment that he'll remember for a long, long time. Any father with kids is forgiven for grabbing a tissue during this hit song.</p></li><li><figure class=img-tag><p><span class=visually-hidden>Warner Brothers</span></p>Warner Brothers<p>loading...</p></figure><span class=count>1</span><h2>'Fishin' in the Dark'</h2>Nitty Gritty Dirt Band<p>The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's 'Fishin' in the Dark' is the No. 1 song on this fishing songs list because it's so much fun -- and because it's remained a fan favorite for over 25 years. Truthfully, the song isn't really about fishing, but the heavy use of euphemisms is part of what makes this song so special.</p></li></ul><h2>What Are Your Favorite Fishing Songs?</h2><p>Is there a fishing song that you think should be on this list of the 10 best fishing songs?
