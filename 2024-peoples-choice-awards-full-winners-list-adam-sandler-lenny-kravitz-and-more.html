The awards season is now in full swing as actor <strong>Simu Liu</strong> (Barbie,&nbsp; Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings) took the reins as the host for the night.

The ceremony included a heartfelt tribute from his friend <strong>Jennifer Aniston,</strong> highlighting his contributions to the film industry as an actor, writer, and producer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrityaccess.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/sandler_aniston-300x130.png><p>Sandler, known for his trademark humor, kicked off with a story about a supposed mix-up, claiming he had mistakenly believed he had earned PEOPLE’s Sexiest Man Alive title and re-cited his pre-written speech for that very award. Laughing at himself, he read from his paper, declaring himself the “<span>sexiest man alive</span>” and thanking the “<span>PEOPLE Magazine’s academy members of hotness and sexual attractiveness</span>.”</p><p>Sandler expressed gratitude for being recognized with the People’s Icon Award. In Sandler’s style of humor, he remarked, “<span>I am trying to be gracious, PEOPLE Magazine, but I have to admit three words keep popping into my head right now: ‘It’s about freaking time!’</span>” a nod to his his longstanding presence in the industry.</p><p>Sandler’s career spans over three decades, featuring box office hits such as Grown Ups, The Longest Yard, Mr. Deeds, Billy Gilmore, Happy Madison, and many more. His films have collectively grossed over $3 billion globally, and his Netflix offerings remain among the most-streamed movies.</p><p>Stepping outside of his “comfort zone,” Sandler has also received critical acclaim for his dramatic roles in Uncut Gems, Hustle, and Big Daddy. News of his award follows his most recent 2023 sold-out comedy tour, I Missed You, and next is the science-fiction movie Spaceman, set for release on February 23. &nbsp;Sandler continues to diversify his portfolio.</p><p>The decorated comedian boasts a collection of awards, including nine People’s Choice Awards, six MTV Movie Awards, and 12 Kids’ Choice Awards. In 2023, he was honored with the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.&nbsp;Sandler joins an esteemed list of previous People’s Icon Award recipients, including <strong>Aniston, Ryan Reynolds, Halle Berry, <a href=#><span>Jennifer Lopez</span></a>,</strong> and<strong> Melissa McCarthy.</strong></p><p><span><a href=#><span><strong>Lenny Kravitz</strong></span></a></span> was honored with the <strong><span>People’s Music Icon Award,</span></strong> presented to him by triple Grammy Award winner <a href=#><span><strong>Victoria Monét.</strong></span></a> The rocker delivered a powerful mini-set of his classic hits and offered reflections on his journey during an emotional speech.</p><p>The respected musician shared what he believes the term “icon” means by saying<span>, </span><span><span>“</span>It means a lot of things to a lot of people. To me, it means you’ve made an indelible mark by being who God created you to be. And, daring to be different<span>.”</span></span> Reflecting on his early days, Kravitz revealed the challenges he faced when many sought to mold him into a different artist. Despite lucrative offers, he chose authenticity over conformity.</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;“</span>When I was first coming up, a lot of people offered me a lot of deals, but they wanted me to change. My music wasn’t black enough, it wasn’t white enough. It didn’t fit nicely inside a box. Or sound like what was on the radio at the time – and I turned down the money and the glitzy promises of fame and stardom because I couldn’t live with myself doing something inauthentic<span>.”</span></span></p><p>Kravitz’s own trajectory, marked by 11 albums, 40 million records sold, and four Grammys, has never been solely about commercial success or awards. Instead, he emphasized the importance of enjoying the journey, expressing gratitude, and utilizing the gifts that he believes God has given him. Kravitz remains steadfast in his mantra:<span><span> “</span>Never follow the trends, set your own pace, and recognize that the best is here right now in front of you. </span><span>I was a fan of music long before I was a musician<span>.”</span></span></p><p><span>Here’s the complete list of nominees, with winners in bold.</span></p><p><strong>Male artist of the year</strong><br>Bad Bunny<br>Drake<br>Jack Harlow<br><strong>WINNER: Jung Kook</strong><br>Luke Combs<br>Morgan Wallen<br>Post Malone<br>The Weeknd</p><p><strong>Female artist of the year</strong><br>Beyoncé<br>Doja Cat<br>Karol G<br>Lainey Wilson<br>Miley Cyrus<br>Nicki Minaj<br>Olivia Rodrigo<br><strong>WINNER: Taylor Swift</strong></p><p><strong>Male country artist of the year</strong><br>Chris Stapleton<br>Cody Johnson<br>HARDY<br><strong>WINNER: Jelly Roll</strong><br>Kane Brown<br>Luke Combs<br>Morgan Wallen<br>Zach Bryan</p><p><strong>Female country artist of the year</strong><br>Ashley McBryde<br>Carly Pearce<br>Carrie Underwood<br>Gabby Barrett<br>Kelsea Ballerini<br><strong>WINNER: Lainey Wilson</strong><br>Megan Moroney<br>Shania Twain</p><p><strong>Male Latin artist of the year</strong><br><strong>WINNER: Bad Bunny</strong><br>Bizarrap<br>Feid<br>Manuel Turizo<br>Maluma<br>Peso Pluma<br>Rauw Alejandro<br>Ozuna</p><p><strong>Female Latin artist of the year</strong><br>Ángela Aguilar<br>Anitta<br>Becky G<br>Kali Uchis<br>Karol G<br>Rosalía<br><strong>WINNER: Shakira</strong><br>Young Miko</p><p><strong>Pop artist of the year</strong><br>Billie Eilish<br>Doja Cat<br>Dua Lipa<br>Jung Kook<br>Miley Cyrus<br>Olivia Rodrigo<br>Tate McRae<br><strong>WINNER: Taylor Swift</strong></p><p><strong>Hip-hop artist of the year</strong><br>Cardi B<br>Drake<br>Future<br>Jack Harlow<br>Latto<br><strong>WINNER: Nicki Minaj</strong><br>Post Malone<br>Travis Scott</p><p><strong>R&B artist of the year</strong><br><strong>WINNER: Beyoncé</strong><br>Brent Faiyaz<br>Janelle Monáe<br>SZA<br>Tems<br>The Weeknd<br>Usher<br>Victoria Monét</p><p><strong>New artist of the year</strong><br>Coi Leray<br><strong>WINNER: Ice Spice</strong><br>Jelly Roll<br>Jung Kook<br>Noah Kahan<br>Peso Pluma<br>PinkPantheress<br>Stephen Sanchez</p><p><strong>Group/duo of the year</strong><br>Dan + Shay<br>Fuerza Regida<br>Grupo Frontera<br>Jonas Brothers<br>Old Dominion<br>Paramore<br><strong>WINNER: Stray Kids</strong><br>TOMORROW X TOGETHER</p><p><strong>Song of the Year</strong><br>Dua Lipa, “Dance the Night”<br>Luke Combs, “Fast Car”<br>Miley Cyrus, “Flowers”<br>Gunna, “Fukumean”<br>Tate McRae, “greedy”<br>Morgan Wallen, “Last Night”<br>Doja Cat, “Paint the Town Red”<br><strong>WINNER: Olivia Rodrigo, “Vampire”</strong></p><p><strong>Album of the year</strong><br>Miley Cyrus, Endless Summer Vacation<br>Drake, For All the Dogs<br>Luke Combs, Gettin’ Old<br><strong>WINNER: Olivia Rodrigo, Guts</strong><br>Karol G, Mañana Será Bonito<br>Bad Bunny, Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana<br>organ Wallen, One Thing at a Time<br>Nicki Minaj, Pink Friday 2</p><p><strong>Collaboration song of the year</strong><br>Lil Durk Feat.
