For some of us it doesn’t even matter what the <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">temperature is outside</a>, our bodies just run hot and get sweaty all year round. I am one of those unlucky folks who glisten no matter the season, so I was intrigued by the launch of the Pretty Active Collection from Soap & Glory, a body spray, body lotion, and body wash developed to help keep sweat at bay.&nbsp;</p><p>The Spritz In The City Instant Cooling Spray (<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$6.00, Ulta</a>) caught my eye first. Like the other two products, it lists cooling agents like aloe, cucumber, and calming chamomile as the powerhouses behind its Revita-Cool Technology. The spray bottle is the perfect size for stashing in a purse or tote bag. I tested it in the sauna-like temperatures of a New York City subway platform on a particularly warm day.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/cooling-body-spray.jpeg><p class=caption style=text-align:center>(Photo Credit: FirstForWomen.com)</p><p>I pumped a few spritzes on the pulse points of my wrists and neck. These are the areas where your blood vessels are closest to the skin and emit a more noticeable pulse — and also make it so any cooling sensations can be carried throughout the rest of your body. The spray didn’t magically make me sweat-free while waiting for my train to arrive, but I did feel slightly cooler than I usually do. Plus, the Original Pink “fruity and floral” scent was a nice distraction from the other smells that can surround you on a hot summer NYC day.&nbsp;</p><p>The Lotion Activated Odour Masking Body Lotion (<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$10.00, Ulta</a>) and Shower Ranger Cooling Body Wash (<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$9.00, Ulta</a>) had similar results for me. They didn’t make all the heat in my home instantly go away, but having the lotion on my skin made my muggy living room a bit <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">more bearable</a> when the temperature climbed into triple digits and my tiny air conditioner struggled to keep up. The shower gel was the one that seemed least helpful to me as far as not really cooling both while lathering up or once I got out, but I still enjoy the Pink fragrance.&nbsp;</p><p>Some reviews on Ulta complain about the aroma being a little overpowering, but I was never bothered by it. To each their own, of course, but it might be worth a shot to see if these products can help cool you down.&nbsp;</p><p>We write about products we think our readers will like.
