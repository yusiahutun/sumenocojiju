(<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>WFLA</a>) — The star of the show (so to speak) during April’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>total solar eclipse</a> is clearly the corona of the sun, visible only because the moon will have blocked Earth from the sun’s light (for areas inside the path of totality). But the darkness does give you a chance to see some planets, stars and even possibly a comet that passes by every 71 years.</p><p>As we approach 100% totality, the first planet visible could be Venus. At about 15 degrees from the sun, it will be the brightest planet in the sky, and may be visible a little before, during, and after totality. (Hint: For an easy way to use degrees to look for an object in the sky, close your fist and stretch it out straight, completely at arm’s length. The width of your fist is roughly 10 degrees.)</p><a href=# class=promo-link__link>2024 total solar eclipse: Should I trek into the path of totality?</a><p>The next and most likely planet you will be able to see is Jupiter. It will not be visible until the 100% period of totality. It will be more faint than Venus, but should be visible to the naked eye. Jupiter will be about 30 degrees from the eclipsed sun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wfla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-27-150214.png><p>Here’s a wildcard: The 12P/Pons-Brooks comet, which returns once every 71 years, will be blazing by at the time. It is not guaranteed to be visible, but there is a small chance that it could flare up and put on a show.</p><p>The comet is a ball of dirt and ice, and somewhat routinely, chunks break off and cause bright flares of light. It has also been nicknamed the “Devil Comet” or the “Millennium Falcon” because of dual flares that give the comet the appearance of horns.</p><p>If you’re hoping to glimpse the comet, it will be about 25 degrees from the sun.</p><a href=# class=promo-link__link>These states will be in the ‘path of totality’ during the 2024 eclipse</a><p>Experts advise viewers not to spend too much time looking for planets, which are visible at other times. The next occurrence of an eclipse in the continental U.S., however, is roughly 20 years away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wfla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2024/02/GettyImages-141276611.jpg><p>Should you glance around during the eclipse, though, it will look like twilight near the horizon for 360 degrees. Also, listen up: Crickets may begin chirping and birds may begin roosting behaviors, temporarily confused about the onset of nighttime.</p><p>You’re likely to feel the effects of the eclipse, too. The sudden onset of darkness is expected to lower the temperatures by about 10 degrees — and the drop would be even more drastic if it were wintertime with clear skies, falling about 20 degrees.</p><p>The total eclipse will be visible from parts of the U.S. on April 8.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfmrCttc%2BsnGZqYGeBcK%2FOppytZaChrq%2Bx06xkrKyRp8Buucign61lkaHAsHnBnmSvoaOer62xjJ2sq6GenHpzfJFtZK2npJa5br%2FOpZirZZWYuaq80p5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
