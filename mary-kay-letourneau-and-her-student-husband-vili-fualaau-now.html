But she later said that — at first — there was nothing illicit about her feelings. "I didn't know what it meant," she said. "I felt that one day he might marry my daughter."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the next several years, Letourneau kept in touch with the child.

Her marriage was in trouble, and in January 1996, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Letourneau experienced a miscarriage</a> that left her on the brink of a breakdown.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She apparently took solace in her connection with Fualaau.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-june-1996-mary-kay-letourneau-draws-vili-fualaau-closer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>June 1996: Mary Kay Letourneau draws Vili Fualaau closer</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Alan Berner/AP</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a 1998 book they authored with a ghostwriter — titled Un Seul Crime, L'Amour (Only One Crime, Love) — Letourneau and Fualaau set forth their account of their relationship, from her recognition of his artistic talent in her second-grade class to his precocity when she had him in class again as a sixth grader at Shorewood Elementary in Burien, Wash.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At age 12, Fualaau claimed he bet a friend $20 he would have sex with Letourneau.

What he didn't know at the time was that she was already six months pregnant with Fualaau's baby.

"I feel Mary has been punished enough for her mistake," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Judge Linda Lau sentenced her to seven and a half years, suspending all but six months on the condition that Letourneau enter a treatment program for sex offenders, take medication for her bipolar disorder and have absolutely no contact with Fualaau.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But prosecutors argued Letourneau was not to be trusted, and it soon became clear they had a reason. While finishing her six months behind bars, Letourneau began taking the drug Depakote to treat her bipolar disorder. But within days of her release, on Jan. 2, 1998, she had stopped taking it and was rebelling against her sexual-deviancy counselor.
