Take an inside look at Drake’s $185 million baby blue private jet, which has the rapper's OVO owl logo on the exterior.
Published on July 27, 2022   2 min read Drake is known for having expensive tastes (after all, his Instagram name is “Champagne Papi” for a reason), and the rapper even has his own $185 million private jet. Here’s what we know about Drake’s personal plane, how he got it, and why it’s causing controversy."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Here’s what we know about Drake’s personal plane, how he got it, and why it’s causing controversy.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-inside-drake-s-185-million-private-jet>Inside Drake’s $185 million private jet</h2><p id=par-2_56>Drake is the proud owner of a massive converted Boeing 767 jet worth about $185 million. As far as personal planes go, Drake’s is much larger than average. The jet served as a cargo plane for 23 years before the rapper got it, and it has an impressive 206-ton cargo capacity and a 20,000-gallon fuel tank.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_49>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider</a>, the <a href=#>former Degrassi star</a> enlisted the help of <a href=#>Virgil Abloh</a> to redesign and customize the jet. Abloh is best known as the artistic director of Louis Vuitton from 2018 until <a href=#>his death in 2021</a>. He was also the founder and CEO of the luxury brand Off-White.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_31>The outside of the jet is a baby blue color, with Drake’s OVO owl symbol emblazoned on both sides. The plane’s name, “Air Drake,” is also written prominently on the exterior.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_59>The interior boasts multiple bedrooms, a private living room, a large cabin area full of leather recliners and velvet sofas, carpeted floors, lots of decorative mirrors, work areas, a theater area, and gold and hardwood accents. Homey accents like lamps and tables make the jet feel more like a luxury home in the sky rather than a transportation vehicle.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-drake-s-private-jet-was-a-gift>Drake’s private jet was a gift</h2><p id=par-6_51>According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Drake’s net worth is estimated at $250 million, so he likely could have afforded the $185 million private jet. But the <a href=#>Grammy Award-winning rapper</a> didn’t have to pay a dime for the plane because it was a gift from the Canada-based airline that made it, Cargojet.</p><p id=par-7_41>“Supporting homegrown businesses has always been a top priority of mine, so when an opportunity came up to get involved with a great Canadian company I was honored to do so,” Drake said in a statement provided by Cargojet (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yahoo</a>).</p><p id=par-8_57>“We are very excited to partner with Drake as our ambassador and assisting him with his logistical needs and requirements,” said Cargojet’s CEO, Ajay Virmani. “We have had a lengthy relationship with Drake and this partnership has grown organically between both parties. Cargojet and Drake are both great Canadian successes, we are thrilled to be partnering together.”</p><h2 id=h-the-rapper-recently-came-under-fire-for-seemingly-taking-a-14-minute-flight>The rapper recently came under fire for seemingly taking a 14-minute flight&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-9_53>Drake and his private jet were recently at the center of some controversy after the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> account @CelebJets reported that the rapper took a 14-minute flight on the personal plane. Fans and activists complained that emissions from the frivolous flight from Hamilton, Ontario to Toronto had an unnecessarily negative impact on the environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_51>But Drake responded to the criticism by commenting on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> page of @RealTorontoNewz, which had picked up the story. “This is just them moving planes to whatever airport they are being stored at for anyone who was interested in the logistics,” the <a href=#>Honestly, Nevermind rapper</a> wrote. “Nobody takes that flight.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS2r7%2FInZxmnKKWuKa%2FjGpvbmWdnrmttc6nZJuZkq56o7jUnmSpqpmrrrWxjKOcrWWXpMFustGenGegpKK5cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
