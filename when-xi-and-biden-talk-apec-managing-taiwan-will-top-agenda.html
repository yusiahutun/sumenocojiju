The US has tried to convey that, most recently with a statement by Laura Rosenberger, head of the American Institute in Taiwan, Washington’s de facto embassy, that the US does not support Taiwan independence.</p>Speaking in Taipei last month, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Rosenberger</span></a> said that maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is central to the island’s security and prosperity, adding that US policy will not change regardless of the outcome of Taiwan’s January 13 election.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But risks are mounting as the three governments grapple with their respective domestic pressure groups, each worried that one of the other two could move first, creating a classic security dilemma.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China’s major PLA overhaul has one goal in mind – Taiwan</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“And so they take actions that continue to gin us all up, wind us up, rather than reinforce” the current state of affairs, said Amy Celico, a former senior official at the Commerce Department and the US Trade Representative office responsible for China policy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Every side of that triangle can point to actions by another side of the triangle that are undermining the security and the status quo.
