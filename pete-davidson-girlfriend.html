Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson’s relationship was a huge cultural moment for any Kardashian fan. Kim and Pete met on the set of&nbsp;Saturday Night Live&nbsp;in October 2021 when the Skims founder hosted an episode of the famous sketch comedy show. Kim&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recalled the moment</a>&nbsp;that she wanted to be closer to Pete on an episode of&nbsp;The Kardashians.&nbsp;</p><p>She remembered the time that she hit Pete up after she hosted&nbsp;Saturday Night Live&nbsp;in October 2021. In a confessional featured in an episode of&nbsp;The Kardashians, she said, “I called the producer at&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;and was like, ‘Hey, do you have Pete’s number? And they were like, ‘Yeah.’ I texted him. I wasn’t even thinking like, ‘Oh my God, I’m gonna be in a relationship with him.’ I was just thinking, ‘Heard about this BDE, need to get out there, I need to jumpstart my…’” Kim told the cameras with a smile, “I was just basically DTF.” Pete also has a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tattoo</a>&nbsp;commemorating the moment. The tattoo says “Jasmine to my Aladdin,” which references their&nbsp;Saturday Night Live&nbsp;sketch where they bothplayed the main characters from Disney’s&nbsp;Aladdin. The sketch also featured their first kiss together.</p><p>A source confirmed to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Page Six</a>&nbsp;on August 5, 2022, that Kim and Pete had&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>broken up</a>&nbsp;after nine months of dating. “Kim and Pete have decided to just be friends,” the insider said. “They have a lot of love and respect for each other, but found that the long distance and their demanding schedules made it really difficult to maintain a relationship.” A the time, Pete was filming a movie in Australia, while Kim is based in Calabasas, California, where she lives with her four kids: North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm (Kim shares her children with her ex-husband, Kanye West, whom she filed for divorce from in February 2019.)</p><p>According to Page Six’s source, Kim and Pete’s 13-year age difference was part of the reason for their split&nbsp; “Pete is 28 and Kim is 41 — they are just in very different places at the moment,” the insider said. “Pete is totally spontaneous and impulsive and wants her to fly to New York, or wherever he is on a moment’s notice.” The source continued, “But Kim has four kids and it isn’t that easy. She needs to focus on the kids.” The insider also revealed that Kim’s businesses, including Skims, KKW Beauty, KKW Fragrance and SKKN, have made keeping a relationship difficult for her. “[She’s] totally exhausted by this relationship and other things going on in her life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfpbK1sYydmK%2BhlKi8r3nGoqmlnqKesq%2Bwjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
