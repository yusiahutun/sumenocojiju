The 29-year-old star graces the cover of the July issue of Allure, where she opens up about what it's like to play an inmate onscreen.
&#34;It's totally liberating,&#34; she tells the mag. &#34;There's freedom in not having to make it about how my jeans fit or what my boobs look like in a top."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"There's freedom in not having to make it about how my jeans fit or what my boobs look like in a top. All I have to do now is play."</p><p>In her day-to-day life, the actress doesn't stress much about her appearance either. "I don't feel bound by my face or my body," she admits. "I don't feel like that's the biggest gift I have to offer the world.
