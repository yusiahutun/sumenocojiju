She was nominated 10 times, winning Pop Artist of the Year, Artist of the Year (voted by fans), Tour of the Year – <a href=#>Eras Tour</a>, TikTok Bop of the Year (Cruel Summer) and Favorite Tour Style.</p><p>Although Taylor Swift won six times at the iHeart Radio Awards, she lost out for Song of the Year and Pop Song of the Year for Cruel Summer. She also didn’t go home with Best Fan Army for her Swifties, and Favorite On Screen: Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, for her concert <a href=#>movie</a>.</p><p>The <a href=#>Grammy</a> winner wasn’t able to attend the event but did pre-record a clip with her gratitude.</p><p>She is currently taking a break from her almost two-year tour, following a stretch in Australia and Singapore.</p><p>The star has been seen enjoying date nights and downtime with her NFL boyfriend <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> while back in the States.</p><p>But in her video, Tay-Tay made sure to thank fans for their support.</p><p>She said: “Hey! I wanted to say thank you so much to anyone who voted for this award.</p><p>“iHeart, you’ve also just been so incredibly supportive over the course of my entire career, but especially this year has been pretty spectacular. I am so grateful for that.</p><p>“You know, to the fans, it is completely up to you to choose how you spend your time, what concerts you want to go to, what music you want to make the soundtrack of your life. And to anyone who has included me in those choices, I am so, so, so thankful for that.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-singer-teases-what-s-to-come>Singer teases what’s to come</h2><p>But the Karma singer couldn’t help but tease her upcoming album that is set to release on April 19.</p><p>Taylor continued: “We have so many exciting things ahead of us. I’m continuing on with the tour and, most importantly, I have a brand new album called&nbsp;<a href=#>The Tortured Poets Department</a>, which comes out on April 19. I cannot wait to share it with you.</p><p>“So, thank you for voting for me for this incredible honor — artist of the year.</p><p>I am so blown away and so thankful and I just can’t wait to keep having fun with you guys because we have a lot of exciting things coming up. Thank you so much.”</p><p>Her next record, which she <a href=#>announced at this year’s Grammy Awards</a>, will be her 11th studio album.</p><p>Fans are also hoping she’ll be releasing a re-record of one of her former albums, as she’s already re-released four out of six to fully own the rights to her full back catalog. The two remaining records she needs to re-record include her debut album and Reputation. Swifties believe Reputation will be next, <a href=#>after ‘teasing’ it with outfits</a> and <a href=#>certain hand gestures</a> lately.</p><p>Only time will tell.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-fans-joke-she-s-been-let-out-of-the-cleaning-cart>Taylor Swift fans joke she’s been ‘let out of the cleaning cart’</h2><p>Fans were over the moon to see Tay-Tay in the pre-recorded clip, as she’s been on the down low during her break.</p><p>But Swifties were quick to joke about Taylor Swift being ‘out of the cleaning cart’, in her appearance.</p><p>This references to how the singer will hide in a huge cleaning or janitor cart and wheeled over to the stage, to avoid Taylor Swift fans seeing her before her stage debut.</p><p>It was a rumor for quite some time, before one listener managed to record her stepping out of the container last year and post it on <a href=#>TikTok</a>, seeming to confirm the rumors.</p><p>One fan wrote: “She is free from the cleaning cart <a href=# rel=nofollow>#TaylorSwift</a>“</p><p>A second joked: “Wait… Tree [PR] finally let her out of that cleaning cart?”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2V%2FcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy02admqajYrewt8RmqqGdXZm2ta%2FHnqpmm5yarq%2B1zaBknJmiqXqiv4ysn56rXaiyprqMmqtmrJiaeqq0xJqprWWilrGqu4yarpqqlKh8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
