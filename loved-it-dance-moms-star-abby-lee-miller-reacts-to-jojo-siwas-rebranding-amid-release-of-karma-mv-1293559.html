JoJo is doing incredible dancing with a lot of paint on her face. It used to be stars and rainbows and pink and lavender and turquoise, and now it's black. It's still her doing incredible dancing, so I don't know if it's so much as a rebranding or just maturing, getting older, wanting to show another side of her. I thought the costumes were over the top, loved it,” Miller added.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="JoJo Siwa’s new look in Karma (PC: Getty Images and IMDb)" title="JoJo Siwa’s new look in Karma (PC: Getty Images and IMDb)" width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2024-04/1712584609_demi-moore-and-bruce-willis-3-2.jpg></p><p>Despite facing criticism and speculation about her new look, Siwa remains steadfast in her commitment to authenticity.
