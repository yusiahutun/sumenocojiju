It was reported that this secret love of Dak is a former Arizona Wildcats' cheerleader,&nbsp;<strong>Rosette Abud</strong>.</p><p>The rumors about them seemed to line up with all the other reports about him and Rosette hanging out on St. Patrick's Day weekend. They seemed to be quite interested in each other.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/../img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/12/dak-with-rosette-ftw.gif alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Dak Prescott with Rosette Abud</strong></p><p><strong>Source: Terez Owens</strong></p><p>Dak Prescott was also seen in San Diego hanging out with her and he's been spotted with her more than once. According to the news, this weekend in San Diego isn't the first time they've hung out as she was also with Dak at his teammate <strong>Ryan Switzer's</strong> wedding in March 2018.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>American football Player Travis Kelce Personal life and his Past affairs</a></p><p>Dak is all about his new girl, and he also brought her along to the Mexican versus Croatian soccer match at AT&T stadium.

Either way, it seems he wants to keep the relationship on the down low, unlike his past relationships.</p><p>While his personal life has been a hot topic in the media these days, Prescott hasn't revealed about his current girlfriend in mass. While most think of the star dating someone secretly, we hope to know more details about his private life very soon.</p><h2>Dak Prescott Past Relationships And Affairs</h2><p>Talking about his previous relationship, he had affair with<strong>&nbsp;Kayla Puzas </strong>in 2014. She is a graduate of&nbsp;a Georgia Southern University.</p><p><strong>Don't Miss: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>American football Hall of Famer Joe Namath relationship with ex-Deborah Mays</a></p><p>Their relationship was made public to their fans via social media posts. However, by 2015 the two parted ways and in a like-minded manner, took&nbsp;deleted all posts they made about their relationship on social media.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/../img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/12/dak-prescott-girlfriend-ftw.gif alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Dak Prescott with&nbsp;Kayla Puzas</strong></p><p><strong>Source: Larry brown sports</strong></p><p>Next came<strong> Yasmine Nicole</strong> who he began dating in September 2016. Nicole works as a model for Playboy and she graced her social media with hints about their relationship. She posted a picture of her at one of Daks game on her Instagram subtlely stating that she was there for him.</p><p>Although it seemed things were good between them, the pair eventually broke up and later Yasmine said that there is no bad blood between them. When a fan asked What had happened with her and Dak, Yasmine replied:</p><p>"Nothing 'happened. Bad timing I guess? He is a great guy but we are both young and working on our careers. He will always be a friend to me and someone I care for."</p><p>Nevertheless, of all his affairs, we hope he finds a good woman and settles down and we pray that all this doesn't distract his attention from his game.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Recommeneded: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>American football safety Jordan Poyer is happy with his wife Rachel Bush and children&nbsp;</a></p><h2>Dak Prescott: Wiki</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/../img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/12/dakquick-facts-ftw.gif alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><ul><li>Dak Prescott was born on July 29, 1993, in Sulphur, Louisiana, USA.</li><li>He is 6 ft 2 inch high and Weighs 235 lb.</li><li>His father is Nathaniel Prescott and his mother Peggy Prescott.</li><li>His mother died on 3 November 2013 after <a href=#>battling colon cancer</a>.</li><li>He posted an image of his mother on behalf of a cancer awareness group Ready Raise Rise.</li><li>Prescott attended Haughton High School in Haughton, Louisiana.</li><li>His net worth is estimated to be&nbsp;$3.5million.</li><li>As of January 2019, he has 1.8 million followers on Instagram.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDsKCkoV6YvK57wKuropucmnxzgYyynJqqo2KurrHRopqapl2bvLDAwZqjpWWhqq6zwMSrmZqbm2KxoreMqameq5OkwbV5w5qroqaXYq5us8iro5%2BqmZq7pXnOq2ShnV2ewG6%2FxJypnqycrnqurdGroJ6c</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
