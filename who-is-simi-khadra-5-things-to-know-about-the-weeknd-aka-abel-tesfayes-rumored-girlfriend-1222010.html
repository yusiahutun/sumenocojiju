Simi is very vocal about being proud of where she is from; she appeared on Jay Shetty’s podcast, where she stated, “I feel lucky because we are Palestinians.”</p><p>She went on to explain, “Being Middle Eastern is inextricable to how we are and how we see the world. You know, anybody who’s come across Middle Eastern culture [would know] it’s a hotbed of literature, art, architecture, mysticism, generosity, understanding, loyalty. Those values are just paradigmatic of Arab culture wherever you find it in the world.”</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h3><strong>Simi is a DJ&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Simi and Haze have performed on some of the world’s top stages as Coachallea.

But I was in the middle of finals when we had to go to Paris and shoot it. That was a whole drama.”</p><p>Simi and Haze jointly run an Instagram account called ‘simihaze’, where they have 1.6 million followers. But they don’t want to be clubbed with “influencers.”</p><p>Haze said in an interview with GQ, “The word influencer has gotten so diluted, it’s overused in a way that now, I never really want to be in that category. We’re very careful about it now, and anything we do has to be really authentic. We don’t tag brands that we don’t have a campaign with or are working closely with or are obsessed with.”</p><p><strong>ALSO READ:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Who is Simi Khadra? 5 things to know about The Weeknd aka Abel Tesfaye’s rumored girlfriend","1222010","https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/is-the-weekend-retiring-soon-singer-goes-back-to-his-birth-name-abel-tesfaye-1221257","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/who-is-simi-khadra-5-things-to-know-about-the-weeknd-aka-abel-tesfayes-rumored-girlfriend-1222010","Is The Weekend retiring soon?
