As Liggon and the other girl went to get into their car, the suspect allegedly "lunged" at the victim with a pocketknife and stabbed her in both the abdomen and chest.</p><p>The suspect, who has not been named publicly due to her age, pleaded "not involved" -- or not guilty -- in court. While her team is arguing the stabbing was done in self defense, prosecutors feel the fight was already over by the time she allegedly pulled the knife. "She was the only person who brought a knife to a fistfight," said prosecutor Priscilla Guerrero.</p><p>"At the end of the day, someone is dead over a dispute over sauce," said the judge, who ordered the suspect to be held until the next hearing this Friday.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:5ed3f22e-1cf4-4ca3-8449-6b26fbbb945b data-container-ref=toofab:article:9af48f9d-e2f5-43f0-9a87-f88fbb4d2dec data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/11/5by4/2023/08/29/113a66e51cf94abfa63c6799ad2f3c24_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Harford County Sheriff's Office</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Rachel Morin Murder: Sheriff Warns Mystery Suspect Could Be 'Serial Killer'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The victim's mother, Joy Liggon, expressed her shock over the "senseless" incident -- telling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>WTOP</strong></a>, "I can't understand how any type of a fight, whether it's over sweet-and-sour sauce or any other topic, could result in a murder."</p><p>"I do want there to be some justice for my child, but I also don't want to ... see multiple families ruined by this," she added.</p><p>"Naima was a beautiful, smart, funny, and unique young lady who loved life. She was loved and admired by so many people," her mother also told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Fox 5</strong></a>. "Naima loved music and the arts, basketball, and she was shaping up to be a master barber. She had just been hired to work at Krispy Kreme as a doughnut specialist and was preparing to get her drivers license."</p><p>"The impact of this senseless loss has affected our family, our friends, and our community," she concluded. "Naima will never see her prom or her graduation. We will not get to see her graduate from college or get married or have kids."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:520172cd-8a8b-4744-8556-696e193b6b72 data-container-ref=toofab:article:9af48f9d-e2f5-43f0-9a87-f88fbb4d2dec data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/49/5by4/2023/08/24/49fb9cc78a2245aa8182aa50375c048b_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Whittier Police Department</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Man Accused of Killing 19-Year-Old Woman 'Kidnapped' from Boyfriend's Car In 'Random' Attack Arrested</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Fma3FfqbKmusCgnKtlm565rbHDZqScnJ%2Bjrq2w0maqsJ2VqXq0u9SrZKyZpZiycA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
