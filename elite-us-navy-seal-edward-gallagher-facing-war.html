One has even called on President Donald Trump to step in and have the case dismissed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Trump has weighed in on the case on Twitter, saying he intervened to ensure Gallagher – who was nominated for the Silver Star for his service – “will soon be moved to less restrictive confinement while he awaits his day in court”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Trump said the move was made “in honour of his past service to our country”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Gallagher, a platoon commander of Seal Team 7, will face a military tribunal at a navy base in San Diego on May 28.
