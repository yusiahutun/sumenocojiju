According to a 2021 census, only 584 people live there full time so it's quiet from the get-go with a number of rooms and guest houses available to holidaymakers who want a more authentic experience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32383570.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1125286556.jpg><p>While it's just a 30-minute journey from Turkey, Kastellorizo is actually part of Greece – and there are a number of ways to get to the island. You can either fly to Antalya, then catch a ferry from the port of Kas, or head to Rhodes, where there's one flight to Kastellorizo's small island airport.</p><p>Skyscanner estimates the cost of return journeys from the UK to Kastellorizo at £227. While you can get a flight to Antalya for around £58 for a return. The ferry from Kas to the island costs from £22 according to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Rome2Rio</a>. But remember, Kas ferryport is a four-hour drive away, reports <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link>the Express</a>. You can also catch ferries from Rhodes to the island, as well as from Piraeus.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32383572.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-537657845.jpg><p>But, why should you go through the effort to make it to this remote Greek island? Kastellorizo, with its rugged coastline, crystal-clear waters full of sea life, and colourful traditional houses scattered on the hillsides, has a unique charm that offers a true break from everyday life. The island's charming harbour, with colourful fishing boats bobbing gently against a backdrop of pastel-coloured buildings, is one of its most iconic sights.</p><p>You can take a leisurely walk along the seafront, soaking up the relaxed vibe and admiring the beautiful views of the sea and surrounding coastline. While history buffs will love exploring Kastellorizo's well-preserved architecture and historical sites. The island boasts several notable landmarks, including ancient Lycian rock tombs carved into the cliffsides and the impressive Castle of the Knights of St. John, which offers incredible vista views.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32383568.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1125296606.jpg><p>Besides its natural beauty and historical attractions, the island also offers plenty of opportunities for outdoor adventures and relaxation. You can spend your days snorkelling or diving in the crystal-clear waters, hiking along scenic trails that crisscross the island, or simply lounging on pristine beaches basking in the Mediterranean sun.</p><p>Kastellorizo is also famous for its delicious cuisine, influenced by its rich history and proximity to Greece and Turkey. You can enjoy fresh seafood caught daily by local fishermen, try traditional Greek and Turkish dishes bursting with flavour.</p>Best cabin bags and accessories for travel <a class=affiliate-title href=# rel=nofollow>Eono 3/4/6 Set Compression Packing Cubes</a> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32197188.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_61Ft6h82PFL_AC_SX569_.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>By closing the strong, full-coverage outer zipper, Eono packing cubes achieve a significant compression effect, which saves a lot of space in your suitcase.
