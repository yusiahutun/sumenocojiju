Now, leading <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>aesthetics&nbsp;</a>expert, Nina Prisk, of Update Aesthetics, has told<strong>&nbsp;HELLO!&nbsp;</strong>that there has been a large increase in the number of patients asking for their fillers to be dissolved or "reset" as the natural look becomes more popular.&nbsp;</p><p id=eS2B3pMXodq data-wc=38>“It’s fantastic to see celebrities such as Kristin celebrating healthy, radiant and naturally- glowing skin,” says Nina Prisk. “And we are fortunate to live in an age where there are more ways than ever to help achieve this.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e4df02a43d19-4351258369829453966869804304229298609378457n.jpg><h2>What exactly is filler dissolving?&nbsp;</h2><p id=ezNxioYniG data-wc=33>"Filler dissolving is a treatment that can be used to quickly break down dermal filler safely and comfortably and it involves having hyaluronidase injected into the lips or face,” Nina shares with<strong>&nbsp;HELLO!&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eJ3Y_5GoQS data-wc=72>"This is an enzyme that exists naturally in your body already, but by injecting it into the area where the filler was placed, it helps to speed up the process of breaking the filler down. The medication used to do this is a prescription-only one so it's essential to have this procedure carried out by a qualified medical practitioner. Because although it’s relatively straightforward there is a risk of an allergic reaction."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/629b23a54f37-gettyimages-1440841222.jpg><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Tweakments for beginners: an aesthetic doctor’s guide to subtle lip and face filler" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/5ee49a513110-cosmetic-skin-clinic-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Tweakments for beginners: an aesthetic doctor’s guide to subtle lip and face filler" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Tweakments for beginners: an aesthetic doctor’s guide to subtle lip and face filler</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eYuq3wcShv data-wc=32>Removing lumps from badly filled lips is one of the main reasons people want their filler dissolved, Nina shared, as well as for people who "have over-plumped their lips and face previously".&nbsp;</p><h2>How Kristin achieved her naturally-glowing skin</h2><p id=eeqttIS6Hr data-wc=15>"The recent pictures of Kristin Davis show skin that is glowing and radiant," says Nina.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b89067f2c341-gettyimages-1970068978.jpg><p id=exnQDlAYjv data-wc=51>"It is likely that she has taken a 360 approach to nurture the health of her skin in order to achieve such naturally-glowing results," Nina adds, suggesting in-clinic radiofrequency treatments, which are a minimally-invasive and effective way to address the impacts of ageing such as wrinkles and sagging skin, can help.&nbsp;</p><p id=eeR90QRNh2 data-wc=73>"These, used in conjunction with Polynucleotides, which are bio-stimulator injectable treatments that rejuvenate and renew skin cells, can help to nurture and nourish skin.," says Nina. "Profhilo is another in-clinic treatment which is favored by many celebrities due to the fact that it rejuvenates and hydrates the skin. It’s essentially an injectable moisturizer made from highly concentrated, purified hyaluronic acid. It can be used on the face, neck and decolletage for overall rejuvenation."</p><h2>Fillers can create natural results when performed correctly&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4d1c4807ce25-satc-cast.jpg><p id=ewg7EGC9Pi data-wc=31>"It’s important to reiterate that when fillers are done properly and by an experienced practitioner they can add gentle and subtle volume which look natural and not over plumped," adds Nina.&nbsp;</p><p id=e0L4RdH8Ck data-wc=68>"However I think that the increasing trend for people wanting filler removal is largely due to the fact that more people are having these treatments performed by unqualified and inexperienced practitioners who are over-filling and plumping their lips and faces. There is a huge trend-shift away from this artificial, over-plumped look and people are now seeking a combination of treatments in order to achieve more natural, subtle results."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaGxqbmlqfXCx16mcq6xdp7Kir9OsZK2nXaiyuXnAp5tmrJiaeqS107KqZqOinsC1tc1mm5qumah6r7HWZqWarKWnrq15y6impGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
