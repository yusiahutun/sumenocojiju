However, she is famous as Elle King’s mother and the former wife of Rob Schneider. Schneider is an American actor, screenwriter, producer, and director who started his career performing stand-up comedy. However, he rose to fame as a cast member and writer for the NBC sketch comedy series “Saturday Night Live” from 1988-1994.</p><p>Following his departure from SNL, he pursued a career in feature films and starred in roles in several comedy films, including “The Hot Chick” (2002), “Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo” (1999), and “Big Stan” (2007). Conversely, his ex-wife, King, was never a mainstay in Hollywood’s elite roster. However, her disappearance from the acting scene has fans curious.</p><p>Here’s everything we know about her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-31_04-23-16-fotor-2023073142442.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Elle_Kings_Mother></span>Who Is Elle King’s Mother?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Elle’s mother, London King, was born to her parents, David and Paula King, on September 27, 1971, in Ohio, United States of America. She grew up in a decent middle-class American household alongside her brother, William Scott King. London King grew up in Wellstone, Ohio, where she had her elementary education.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite being a celebrity in her own right, the former model and actress has not disclosed many details about her upbringing and educational achievements. Consequently, there are no details regarding her educational background. However, online reports show she had a happy childhood and grew up in a stable home with her parents and siblings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-31_04-22-42-fotor-2023073143046.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Does_London_King_Rob_Schneiders_Ex-Wife_Do_for_a_Living></span>What Does London King, Rob Schneider’s Ex-Wife, Do for a Living?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>King began her career as a model, appearing in numerous advertising campaigns. However, she failed in this field, as she did not get modeling offers from any famous brand. Her teenage pregnancy was also another factor that decelerated her modeling career. Hence, most of the gigs she got were small-scale ones.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to her unsuccessful modeling career, Rob Schneider’s ex-wife decided to delve into a different field and tried her hands in the movie sphere. London King got her first big break after scoring the role of Cheryl in the 2000 film, “A Better Way to Die.” The following year, she appeared as Jade in the movie “Raw Fish” (2001) and followed that up with the 2002 film “The Calling,” where she took on the character Ruby Jenkins.</p><p>Despite these roles, her acting career was still unsuccessful. In 2003, London King hopped off the entertainment scene entirely and pursued a different career path. She chose to work as a Doula, a non-medical personnel serving as a birth companion, birth coach, and post-birth supporter.&nbsp;</p><p>King became involved in child fertility advocacy over a decade ago and has become one of the most respected non-medical personnel for her work in the health sector. She is also renowned for being a pillar of support to women. In addition, King runs a website, “Push Love Doula,” where she blogs about childbirth, pregnancy, and child care.</p><p>Motivated by her interest in female infertility, pregnancy, and childbirth, the former actress co-founded the “Cause for the Pause” initiative, a group committed to researching and offering remedies for different infertility and menopausal problems in women. Also, the group works to raise awareness of this problem and inform the public about potential medications and preventative measures.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Children_Does_London_King_Have></span>How Many Children Does London King Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The former actress has two children. Before her marriage to the SNL alum, London King was in a relationship with a mystery man in her teens. The affair with the unknown man resulted in her first pregnancy.</p><p>King gave birth to her first child, Noah, in August 1986. Afterward, she met Schneider in Las Vegas in 1988. Surprisingly, the two hit it off instantly, and their love blossomed quickly. They tied the knot in Las Vegas three days after they met on September 25, 1988.&nbsp;</p><p>The following year, the then-couple welcomed their first and only child, Tanner Elle Schneider, famously known as Elle King, on July 3, 1989. Unfortunately, having a child together did not stop their marriage from being tumultuous. Rob Schneider and London King parted ways on September 1, 1990. After their divorce, King raised their daughter as a single mom.&nbsp;</p><p>While London King’s first child, Noah, stays away from the limelight, her second child, <a href=#>Elle King</a>, grew up to become a renowned singer, songwriter, and actress. Her music blends various genres, including rock, blues, country, and soul.</p><p>Her breakthrough hit was the single “Ex’s & Oh’s,” which reached number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 2015. In addition, she has released three studio albums, “Love Stuff” (2015), “Shake the Spirit” (2018), and “In Isolation” (2021).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-31_04-23-09-fotor-2023073142828.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_Is_London_King_Now></span>Where Is London King Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After her divorce from Schneider, King stayed single for some time. However, she found love again when she met Justin Tessa, a musician. King and Tessa exchanged vows in a private wedding ceremony on January 21, 2000, and have been together since.</p><p>After over 23 years as a couple, they live together in Brooklyn, New York, and seem very much in love. London King often flaunts her man on Instagram, where she posts adorable loved-up photos of them together.&nbsp;</p><p>Like <a href=#>Anna Axster, singer Ryan Bingham’s ex-wife</a>, London King is living her best life and focusing on supporting her children’s careers.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kubC6w6ilZqOZo7RuucSeq2aZk6m8s3nRqJlmq5Odu6a1w56prGWVrXq4tcWeZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
