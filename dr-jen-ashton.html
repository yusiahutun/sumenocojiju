My hair is thicker and healthier, and I feel more confident!”&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to keeping her skin vibrant, youthful and healthy, Dr. Ashton came up with her own inexpensive beauty “hero.”&nbsp; “My mom and grandmother were both low maintenance,” Dr. Ashton reveals.&nbsp;“So they never passed down any beauty tips.&nbsp;They weren’t big on skin products or makeup.&nbsp;I have created my own beauty tip that I have passed on to my daughter:&nbsp;I use cooking oils like olive oil and coconut oil in my bathroom as head to toe moisturizers.&nbsp;I try not to cruise drugstores for beauty products.&nbsp;Otherwise I end up wasting a lot of money.”&nbsp;(Click through to find out <a href=#>the benefits of olive oil for your skin — plus how to use It</a>.)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>On finding joy after heartbreak</h2><p>In 2017, Dr. Ashton’s ex-husband and father of her two children, Alex, 24, and Chloe, 22, died by suicide, and it shook her world. That heartbreak – and the news of designer Kate Spade also succumbing to suicide – gave her the motivation to become a mental health care champion.&nbsp;</p><p>“I believe you have to connect the dots and embrace a holistic approach in addressing anxiety, stress and depression,” says Dr. Ashton, who wrote the books<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Life After Suicide: Finding Courage, Comfort & Community After Unthinkable Loss</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Self-Care Solution</a> in 2019. She finds meditation helpful and sets aside 20 minutes a day to clear her mind.</p><p>In the last couple of years, Dr. Ashton has nurtured her own mental health and found happiness again in her 2022 marriage to TV producer and businessman Tom Werner. In addition, her adorable “Morkie,” named Mason, has also helped keep her spirits up.</p><p>“I love, love animals. They make me feel so happy, and my Mason the Morkie is eight years old,” Dr. Ashton says.&nbsp;“I named him Mason because my dog right out of college&nbsp;— who was very special to me — was named Dixon.&nbsp;I felt that they went together, Mason Dixon.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Screenshot-2023-08-11-at-2.48.47-PM.png><p>For more wonderful tips and insights from Dr. Ashton, be sure to pick up your copy of First For Women and Better Magazine, <a href=#>both on sale now</a>!</p><p><strong>Keep reading more amazing stories from First for Women:</strong></p><p><a href=#>5 Dr. Jen Ashton-Approved Shortcuts to a Healthier You</a></p><p><a href=#>Susan Lucci: “Paying Attention to This Weird Pain Saved My Life!”</a></p><p><a href=#>Holly Robinson Peete On The Struggle Many Women Won’t Talk About: “You Don’t Have to Be Ashamed”</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/Bonnie-1.jpg><p class=has-small-font-size id=block-ecccf0bb-15e0-407f-8d65-bf89f8bda7a6><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bonnie Siegler</a></strong>&nbsp;is an established international writer covering the celebrity circuit for more than 15 years.&nbsp; Bonnie’s resume includes two books that combine her knowledge of entertaining with celebrity health and fitness and has written travel stories which focus on sustainable living.&nbsp; She has contributed to magazines including <a href=#>Woman’s World&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href=#>First for Women</a>,&nbsp;Elle, InStyle, Shape, TV Guide and Viva.&nbsp; Bonnie served as West Coast Entertainment Director for&nbsp;Rive Gauche Media&nbsp;overseeing the planning and development of print and digital content.&nbsp; She has also appeared on entertainment news shows&nbsp;Extra&nbsp;and&nbsp;Inside Edition.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJon56ZnKm1cLDRZqGepl2WwKnAzqc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
