"Amanda used to be big, so since she's been through it she's going to talk to me and give me her overall opinion and advice."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Amanda Register</a>, who documented <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>her weight loss journey on the show Family By the Ton</a>, shares that Thompson "has a very similar story to what I had."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Three years ago, I was 715 lbs., I was on the verge of being completely homebound, and I was diagnosed with endometrial cancer. But then Dr. Proctor performed surgery on me and now my whole life has changed. I've lost close to 500 lbs., and I'm endometrial cancer-free, and I've even gotten married to someone else who had weight loss surgery," Register says. "Surgery has completely saved my life, and now I'm trying to help others do the same thing by getting my life coach/nutritionist/wellness certification."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Thompson tells Register that she feels <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ready to make a change</a>, but has hesitations.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I've watched your journey and it kind of inspired me that it's time, you know? I've watched how you've gotten your life back, and I really want my life back," Thompson says. "But, I ain't trying to be skinny. I ain't never been skinny. You know, I just want to put back on some blue jeans. I just don't want to become obsessed with losing the weight and becoming somebody that I'm not."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, Thompson says, she's been spending time reading internet forums about weight loss surgery that scared her away.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You hear so many horror stories, like, groups that I follow, I might read for two weeks everybody's success. Then the next week you might read, everybody is in the hospital, it's been horrible," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Register says in a separate interview that Thompson may have reservations <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>about weight loss surgery</a>, but it's essential at this point to saving her life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I can tell that Jessica is resistant to surgery, and just making excuses as to why she wouldn't want to get it," Register says. "But right now, with Jessica's health, like she already has health issues, she already has kidney issues, she already has all these problems and it's only going to get worse if she doesn't do anything about the weight."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">New episodes of Too Large stream Wednesdays on Discovery+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iarq3Ax2iuqKWRo3q4scign6Kml2KEcYSMpZmsZZGbv6K1w2arqGWXmsFuw8SinqGsXaG8tL%2BMrKyrn5WnxnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
