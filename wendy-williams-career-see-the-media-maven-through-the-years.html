Though it hasn’t always been an easy road, <a href=#>The Wendy Williams Show</a> star has become known as the self-proclaimed “Queen of Media” and completely transformed her career throughout the past three decades.</p><p>The New Jersey native got her start in the industry after graduating from Northeastern University in 1986 with a degree in communications and a minor in journalism. Prior to her graduation, Wendy secured a job with St. Croix’s WVIS radio station in the Virgin Islands. Less than a year after first starting out in radio, Wendy left WVIS for a job at WOL, a radio station based in Washington, D.C. At the time, Wendy was commuting between D.C. and New York City when working weekend shifts at WQHT.</p><p>In 1989, the fashion designer accepted a position at former WRKS in New York City as a substitute disc jockey. There, Wendy moved around from morning show to afternoon show while leaving a lasting impression. In 1993, she even won the award for Billboard’s “Best On-Air Radio Personality.”</p><p>Wendy lost her job in 1998 after a radio station she worked for was bought out and reformatted. However, she got back on her feet after being hired by Philadelphia-based station WUSL. It wasn’t until 2001 when Wendy returned to New York after being hired full-time.</p><p>In 2008, Wendy made an effortless transition from radio to TV when she launched The Wendy Williams Show. Though the show originally premiered as a six-week test run on Fox stations, creators behind the series knew it would be a success after Wendy immediately began engaging a large audience.</p><p>After only a year since launching her own daytime talk show, Wendy was inducted into The National Radio Hall of Fame in 2009. At the highly notable ceremony, she was introduced by her former radio cohost <strong>Charlamagne tha God</strong>, who called Wendy an “icon.”</p><p>Since launching The Wendy Williams Show, the star has become a staple on daytime television. Sadly, Wendy revealed she was a taking a step back from upcoming public appearances in September 2021 to focus on some “ongoing health issues.” The news was revealed in a <a href=#>statement</a> shared to the talk show’s Instagram account.</p><p>“Wendy is dealing with some ongoing health issues and is undergoing further evaluations,” the statement read. “She will not be able to complete her promotional activities next week, but can’t wait to be back in her purple chair Monday, September 20th for the 13th season premiere.”</p><p>Hopefully, Wendy is feeling better soon.</p><p><strong>To look back at the star’s iconic career over the years, scroll through the gallery below.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wnKecqWLEqrjLopimq12YrrOxxKtkrJ2VYsGpsYymnJ2hkWK6osLEp2StoKKkwqi0jK2fnmWpmq6zv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
