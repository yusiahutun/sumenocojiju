When I decided to join slimming 2 years ago I never thought I'd have it in me to achieve my goal. I decided that day to change my life & believe in myself for once instead of giving up after the first week. It was honestly the best decision I have ever made. Believe in yourself and your already half way there 😊 *************************************************🌟I started slimming world on 29/03/2015 & I weighed 13 stone 4 lbs. 🌟I hit my target of 8 stone about 12 months later & have been maintaining 8 – 8.6 for around 9 months. 🌟I'm 5ft 3 🌟From the start I didn't go to the gym or do any particular exercise other than walking to work & back every day & waking the pooch 🐶 🌟Just recently started tracking my steps & try to do 10,000 step a day. Also started doing yoga at home which I'm really enjoying. 🌟I always have had between 10-15 syns a day unless I've had a weekend off plan I will try reduce my syns to 5ish a day to balance out before weigh in on a Friday. 🌟Generally I follow SP Mon-Thur & then follow extra easy Fri – Sun & find it works really well for me & makes me look forward to my carby weekends 🍝🍝 #slimmingworld #slimmingworlduk #fooddiary #foodoptimising #weightloss #weightlossjourney #weightlosstransformation #weightlossbeforeandafter #healthy #healthyeating #healthyliving #weekendmotivation #transformation #beforeandafter #beforeandafterweightloss #changeyourmindset #beleiveinyourself</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Danielle French</a> (@itsdaniellesjourney) on Feb 12, 2017 at 12:46am PST</p><p>French attests her miraculous weight loss transformation to Slimming World, a <strong><a href=#>weight loss program</a></strong> she joined shortly after the couple booked their wedding for November 2016.
