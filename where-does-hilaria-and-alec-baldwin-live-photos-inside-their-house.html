The couple resides in an 18th-century farmhouse in Long Island that the <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> star purchased in 1995.</p><p>Hilaria later moved in once they started dating in 2011. The shingle-style house — which was built in 1753 — has a lot of space for <a href=#>their six kids</a> to play in, which is perfect for the pair’s growing family.</p><p>“Before [we renovated the house, there] was a lot of tiny little rooms … there wasn’t a lot of flow to it,” the yoga instructor told <a href=#>Elle Decor</a> in 2016, noting they made some renovations when she moved in. In order to create the “really open space” she “definitely wanted,” Hilaria hired architect<strong> Fred Throo</strong> and interior designer <strong>Daniel Romanoff</strong>.</p><p>Now, her kitchen leads into both the living room and the dining room, which is exactly where they hang out during family dinners. But even though the lovebirds did a few updates, they still kept some traditional pieces of the home intact. In the hallway outside of Hilaria and Alec’s bedroom, there’s a reclaimed barn door that stands opposite a beautiful chandelier by designer <strong>Ron Dier</strong>.</p><p>Their children’s bedrooms, however, have a different sense of style. <a href=#>Carmen</a>, whom they welcomed in August 2013, has a gorgeous lavender carpet that matches both the walls and the furniture in her bedroom. Son Rafael, who arrived in June 2015, is always seen in videos playing in a stunning bedroom decorated with cream chairs and a bunch of stuffed animals.</p><p>By the time Hilaria gave birth to Leonardo in September 2016, she planned to make his room a little bit bigger so he didn’t feel left out from the rest of his older siblings. “We want all of our kids to feel like they’re equal, so we’re going to make his room exactly the same square footage as theirs, so that he can’t say ‘I’m third, I’m last, you guys don’t care,'” the fitness guru explained.</p><p>Since then, Hilaria and Alec welcomed son Romeo in May 2018, followed by the son <a href=#>Eduardo in September 2020</a>, as well as their sixth bundle of joy, <a href=#>Lucia, who was born via surrogate</a> in February 2021. With the newest additions to their family, there’s no doubt the “Mom Brain” podcast host and the Beetlejuice alum have made adjustments for their big brood.</p><p>It appears that the three oldest Baldwin boys now share a room together after Hilaria posted a video of them lounging on the carpet with their three beds in the background.&nbsp;Luckily for the couple, their house is already huge so it’s easy to switch the rooms around!</p><p><strong>Scroll below to see pics inside Hilaria and Alec’s East Hampton home.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn56qlWKxsLHSZp%2BipJGntqJ5wKebZpmcmrBursClm7ChnmK5qsLEZqehp6SkwG61zaygnZ1dqbWmtdFmn6ito5p8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
