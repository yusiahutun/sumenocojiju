The 1919 painting, known as “Taking a Break” and “Lazybones,” was returned to members of the Grant family by FBI art crimes agents in Philadelphia last March.

The piece was one of a number of items stolen from the family’s home in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, during a June 30, 1976, break-in.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Grants knew the painting was theirs because it still had damage from where their father had struck it with a pool cue.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Heritage Auctions announced on Wednesday the painting will be auctioned November 3 in Dallas, where it is expected to fetch up to US$1.5 million. But that pool cue damage isn’t part of the deal.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Aviva Lehmann, the auction house’s director of American Fine Art in New York, said a conservator mended the telltale hole and restored the painting.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We were on the fence on whether to offer it as-is or clean it up,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After consulting the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, it was decided to restore it and make it look as fresh as possible.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It looks like it was painted yesterday,” Lehmann said. “The family gasped, it was so startling in a very good way. It literally looks like it was brought back to life.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Robert Grant was playing pool at a friend’s house in 1954 when he drew his cue back a bit too dramatically, damaging one of four Norman Rockwell paintings in the room.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a “you break it, you buy it” moment, Grant paid the pal US$50 for the artwork, which depicts a boy sleeping on the ground, his dozing dog’s head in his lap and the hoe he should be using for chores perched between his knees.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For Grant’s children, being reunited with the painting was emotional, because it meant so much to their late parents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">John Grant said he and his five siblings decided it made the most sense to auction the painting, since no one really felt safe having something that valuable just hanging in their home.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If my dad was still alive it would be back on the wall,” he said. “It was the family jewel, no doubt. It would have been the perfect ending to a really long story.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXy2usitnJ1lo6mutbHSZpqappGZrnCt0a2gnKSVZH9yfZNpbGpno6m8rbHNZqWoqp2Wu26%2BzpyisJ2coXqxrcinq6Kml2K%2FpsDUq6WenF2brq61y7Jkp52n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
