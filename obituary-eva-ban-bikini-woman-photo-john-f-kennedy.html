But well before the internet, the 1962 photo of president John F. Kennedy at the beach in Santa Monica, California, made quite a splash. And for a Los Angeles woman named Eva Ban, its effect lasted a lifetime.
Ban was the woman in the two-piece swimsuit, which was modest by today's standards."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And for a Los Angeles woman named Eva Ban, its effect lasted a lifetime.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ban was the woman in the two-piece swimsuit, which was modest by today's standards.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A few days after the photo ran in newspapers and on television broadcasts around the world, Ban revealed what she and Kennedy were laughing about.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was a woman in the crowd clustering around the tanned, bare-chested, 45-year-old president. "Mabel," the woman yelled to a friend, "I touched him!"</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ban, who was raised in Hungary and studied classical dance, died on March 8 at a care facility in Oakland. She was 94 and had Alzheimer's disease, her daughter Agi Ban said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For several years, Ban had been in nursing homes and hospitals - and the photo had gone along with her, displayed as prominently in her room as it had been in her home. "People treated her differently because they knew who she was," Agi Ban said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Born Eva Charlotte Boross in Long Branch, New Jersey, Ban - the daughter of a Hungarian mother and an American father - grew up in Budapest. Fleeing the Nazis, she moved first to London and then the US.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In mid-August 1962, Kennedy was relaxing by the pool at the beachside home of his brother-in-law, the actor Peter Lawford. Late in the afternoon, Kennedy strode across the sand and plunged into the surf.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Back ashore, Ban was looking for her 13-year-old son, Peter, who had jumped into the surf to see if he could shake the president's hand. The boy didn't succeed, but his mother wound up in an image that would be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize,</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ban declined offers in the wake of her sudden fame. Her husband, architect Alexander Ban, wasn't pleased when Dick Cavett asked her to appear on his TV show in her bikini. "Fine. If you are in your bathing suit, then Dick Cavett must be in his," Agi Ban recalled her father saying.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Bikini woman frozen in time by the smile of JFK</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXyivtOimqWdX2aBeX6RbGdop5Kewbat0bJknq6RYq%2BiuoyboKShnp56uLvMmqVmqJikwbB5yaifp2WWYrimus2em7I%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
