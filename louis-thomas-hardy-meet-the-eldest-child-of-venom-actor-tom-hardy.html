“Venom” actor Tom Hardy is known for his exceptional acting skills. However, most people are unaware he has three kids — two from his wife and one from his ex-girlfriend. Also, there’s a growing interest in his personal life.
So as much as Tom wants to keep his personal life private, especially as regards his children, fans are curious to know more about them."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Let’s meet Tom Hardy’s first child, Louis Thomas Hardy.</strong></p><p>“Venom” actor Tom Hardy is known for his exceptional acting skills. However, most people are unaware he has three kids — two from his wife and one from his ex-girlfriend. Also, there’s a growing interest in his personal life.</p><p>So as much as Tom wants to keep his personal life private, especially as regards his children, fans are curious to know more about them. It’s no wonder his eldest child Louis Thomas Hardy is getting so much attention.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Louis_Thomas_Hardys_Background></span>Louis Thomas Hardy’s Background<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Louis Thomas Hardy is the eldest child of English actor Tom Hardy and his former girlfriend, Rachael Speed. He was born in April 2008 and has a blend of English and Irish ancestry. His father, Tom Hardy, hails from Hammersmith, England.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/6d20e7534c108950f1c84ead98db87ba-fotor-20230629135325.jpg><p>Louis’ paternal grandfather, Chips Hardy, worked as an advertising executive, and his grandmother, Anne Hardy, was an artist. As stated earlier, Tom Hardy keeps his kids from the public eye. Hence, we don’t have info on Louis’s education. However, as Louis is a teenager, he is most likely to study in one of England’s reputable high schools.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Tom_Hardy_Marry_Louiss_Mother></span>Did Tom Hardy Marry Louis’s Mother?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Louis Thomas Hardy’s parents first met on the set of the 3005 BBC miniseries “The Virgin Queen.” In the series, Hardy played the character of the 1st Earl of Leicester, and Louis’ mother, Rachel Speed, was the series’ assistant director. The duo fell in love on their first meeting and started dating the following year.</p><p>Sadly, soon after the birth of Louis in 2008, his parents separated. Tom and Rachael never got married and never revealed the reason behind their short-lived relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite not being with Louis’mother anymore, Tom has been a great father to Louis just as he has been a great son to Tom. So great that he became Tom’s source of strength to fight his demons.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tom_Hardys_Addiction></span>Tom Hardy’s Addiction<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Our favorite anti-hero actor was once addicted to crack cocaine and alcohol. This was during his early twenties.</p><p>According to Tom, it was the birth of Louis that pushed him to check into rehab. The actor stated that he has been self-indulgent for a long time and thought only about himself and his stupid stuff. However, having a child lifted him from selfish behavior and gave him responsibility. It forced him to be a better man and live a healthy life.</p><p>Tom has been sober ever since the birth of Louis. He is also actively involved in charity and is the ambassador of the Prince’s Trust. He also became the Commander of the Order of The British Empire (CBE) in 2018. All these he credits to his son coming into his life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ddebd3dd09f13cd65e757dd2a92c5b86-fotor-20230629135510.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Louis_Thomas_Hardy_Coach_Tom_Hardy_for_His_Role_as_%E2%80%9CVenom%E2%80%9D></span>Did Louis Thomas Hardy Coach Tom Hardy for His Role as “Venom”?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to Tom Hardy, his son Louis played a significant role in helping him prepare for his portrayal of Eddie Brock in the film “Venom.” In an interview with <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2018, Hardy mentioned that Louis was essentially in the driver’s seat for most of the preparation process. He relied on his son as an expert on the anthology and mythology of the character.</p><p>Tom acknowledged that his son pointed out what he was doing wrong and made more mistakes than correct choices. As a child, Louis was brutally honest and clear about what he could and couldn’t do in the role, and his father considered him a little spirit guide.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tom_Hardy_Is_Louis_Real-Life_Hero></span>Tom Hardy Is Louis’ Real-Life Hero<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite being very strict about his children’s privacy, Tom did give us a clue that Louis was really into comics. During the 2018 Comic-Con, Tom Hardy revealed that one of the reasons he actively pursued roles in Marvel films was to create a movie that his son, Louis, would watch and appreciate. He expressed that his son was a huge fan of “Venom,” which strongly influenced his decision to play the character.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/951da3c98d028aa1cd9377ac8776cf3d-fotor-20230629135612.jpg><p>Tom Hardy prioritizes parenting and has consciously decided to spend most of his time with his children. Despite movie opportunities, he has chosen not to settle in Hollywood full-time to maintain close contact with his son Louis, who lives in London with his mother. Tom emphasizes the importance of being present for his son, stating that any time away from him feels like a loss.</p><p>Being a parent to Louis and his other two children has given Tom a sense of purpose and has made him more mindful of how he lives his life. He takes pride in being a father and is committed to supporting his children as they navigate their paths in the world.</p><p>It’s no doubt that Louis has it going well for himself and his family. The story of a child changing his father continues with <a href=#>Chris Brown</a> and his son Aeko Catori Brown.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kubDByKxkraCfoq60eceaqZ2xXaKypsCMrZ%2BeZZWhsaa%2F02aaoaGcmXqwsoyvnKennWKupMDOq2Stp51itaK%2Bw7Jm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
