“My favorite skit was Lulu’s Truck Stop,” Lulu, 72, shared. “Not only did we get to eat, it was basically me throwing food at everybody!"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

You ain’t heard nothin’ yet! To celebrate the show’s 50th anniversary, Closer Weekly exclusively caught up with original cast members <strong>J<span>ana Jae</span></strong><span>, <strong>Lulu Roman</strong>, <strong>Misty Rowe</strong> and <strong>Buck Trent</strong>&nbsp;in the magazine’s latest issue (on newsstands now!) to hear all about their funniest down-home memories.</span></p><p>“My favorite skit was Lulu’s Truck Stop,” Lulu, 72, shared. “Not only did we get to eat, it was basically me throwing food at everybody! The best and worst memory was the Kornfield. We would jump on apple boxes, and by day four, honey, everyone was mad because their legs were so sore.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/hee-haw1.jpg><p>Thanks to overalls-clad <strong>Junior Samples,</strong> they got some relief. “He had a jug with real moonshine and said, ‘Hi, everybody! Want a swig?’” fiddler Jana, 75, recalled. The mischief didn’t end there. “<strong>Gailard Sartain</strong> did the countdown [to start shooting], and about the time he got to three, he always made everyone laugh, usually with a cough and a fart noise!” Lulu said with a chuckle.</p><p>The show’s legendary guest stars also made a lasting impression. <strong>Roy Rogers</strong> and <strong>Dale Evans</strong> “sparred off camera — Dale was definitely the boss!” Jana revealed. Buck, 80, was impressed by <a href=#><strong>Dolly Parton</strong></a> (“She’d write a classic song in five minutes!”) and he knows one secret to her long-lasting marriage: “<a href=#>Carl [Dean]</a>&nbsp;stays home because he found out quick people are going to bump him out of the way to talk to Dolly!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/lulu-roman.jpg><p>For all the hijinks, “The best thing about Hee Haw was to come to the set because we quickly became family,” Lulu said. While they agree cohosts <strong>Roy Clark</strong> and <strong>Buck Owens</strong> were very different, “They were so good together! Buck was always rested and ready to go, while Roy was a goofball.” And to Misty, 68, “getting to know <strong>Minnie Pearl</strong> deeply” is her favorite memory. “We’d talk about life, love, children. She made you feel special.”</p><p>For more on Hee Haw, pick up the latest issue of Closer Weekly, on newsstands now — and be sure to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable>sign up for our newsletter</a> for more exclusive news!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46hnJ5lmJbEbq%2FArKtmq5iWv6a%2FjK2fnqGiYrOiws6roK2dXai1sMOMppymp6KesrR5xLGapa2jnsOmew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
