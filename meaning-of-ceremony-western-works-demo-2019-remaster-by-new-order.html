The overall theme of the song revolves around the complexities of human relationships, the passage of time, and the inherent change that comes with it. Through the carefully crafted lyrics and haunting melodies, the band explores the cyclical nature of emotions and experiences, emphasizing the importance of embracing the present moment and the growth that accompanies it.One standout lyric from the song is "You will find that words unnerve me, Different time, the same old story." These words speak to the profound impact that communication can have on our emotional state. It suggests that despite the passage of time, certain timeless and universal stories persist. The theme developed here is the power of words to evoke both positive and negative emotions, their ability to transcend time and connect us to others across generations.Another significant lyric in the song is "I'll break them all, no mercy shown, And Heaven knows, it's got to be someone." This line delves into the theme of individual agency and the struggle to take control of one's own life. It implies a sense of defiance and determination to overcome obstacles, even if it means breaking societal norms or expectations. The theme developed here is the importance of self-empowerment and the pursuit of personal fulfilment, no matter how challenging or unconventional society may deem it to be.The verse "Avenues all lined with trees, Picture me and then you start watching" introduces a visually evocative image that symbolizes the paths we choose in life and the scrutiny that often accompanies it. The interplay between the avenues lined with trees and the act of being watched suggests the curiosity and voyeurism inherent in human nature. This lyric develops the theme of self-awareness and the constant observation one experiences when navigating through life. It highlights the need to stay true to oneself amid the expectations and judgments of others.Finally, the repeated phrase "Forever watching love grow" in the outro carries a profound sense of hope, longing, and the relentless pursuit of love. This refrain underscores the central theme of the song – the eternal search for connection, understanding, and growth. It conveys a sense of optimism and resilience, emphasizing the beauty and transformative power of love in all its forms.In conclusion, "Ceremony (western Works Demo) [2019 Remaster]" is a song that delves into the complexities of relationships, the passage of time, and the ever-present need for growth and connection.
