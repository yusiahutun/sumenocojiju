But that doesn't mean he doesn't have any opinions on the current brand. Specifically on those ubiquitous Kendall Jenner ads. During a discussion with Fern Mallis at the Savannah College of Art and Design, Fashionista reported that Klein was not terribly impressed by the 20-year-old model. When asked by Mallis what he thought of Jenner's #MyCalvins campaign, which is heavily inspired by the iconic images he produced in the '90s, Klein replied, &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I'm honestly not." After being pressed to elaborate by Mallis, Klein said, "I'm sure she's a lovely young woman. It's not the kind of thing I would have done, even today. Justin Bieber, yes."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In fact, Klein was a big fan of Bieber's ads and explained why he preferred those over Jenner's: "When [I say] I like Justin Bieber in the Calvin Klein Underwear [campaign], it's because I like him — not because he's got millions of followers."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Now, models are paid for how many followers they have. They're booked not because they represent the essence of the designer, which is what I tried to do — they're booked because of how many followers they have online. I don't think that, long-term, is going to work. I don't think that's a great formula for success for the product you're trying to sell."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We wonder what Kendall Jenner&nbsp;and her 54.3 million Instagram followers&nbsp;think of his comments.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6GutbHSrWaaaWVmgnp7wpqjr6GeYritscinZKSdnpmurbiMo5ynppWnerS0wJ2caA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
