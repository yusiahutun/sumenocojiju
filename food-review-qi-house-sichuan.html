The music playing over the loudspeakers was our first clue; the stylish decor was the second.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I knew the hostess, Carrie, from other restaurants, and asked why she'd left her previous group. She said she was excited about the food they were serving at Qi, and her enthusiasm seemed genuine.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The interior of the restaurant was sectioned off into small, cosy dining areas. We were seated at a table overlooking the terrace, which had a steady stream of smokers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The menu indicates whether the dishes are spicy and/or mala (numbing from the Sichuan peppercorns), vegetarian or signature. We stuck mostly to the signature dishes, while attempting to order a few that would not overwhelm the taste buds of one of my guests who has a delicate palate.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Our starters were excellent. Mouth-watering chicken (HK$80) really did get our salivary glands going with the delicious, rich, oily sauce. Even better were the chilli wonton (HK$75), which had a light and juicy filling.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We ordered the chilli Dungeness crab (HK$595), although I worried the spiciness would overwhelm the sweetness of the shellfish. The crab was slightly overcooked (it was a little tough) but its freshness shone through.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The spice was mostly on the outside of the shell so it could be avoided by using the crab crackers to get at the meat, rather than pulling it out with one's teeth to get both the spice and crab with each bite.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fish with chilli oil (HK$210) was a little overwhelming at first. It had dried chillies, which were easy to avoid because most of them were in big pieces, as well as fresh chillies, which were more insidious because the small pieces were hidden among the ingredients, especially the bean sprouts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We were told that the sliced fish was from fresh water, not the ocean, but, fortunately, it didn't have a muddy taste. The (mung bean sheets) really absorbed the sauce, which was tolerable as long as you avoided most of the chillies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fresh young jade sprouts (HK$90) cooked with garlic were crunchy and soothed our palates. The one dish that disappointed was the sweet vinegar spare ribs (HK$105). The flavour of the rich, dark sauce hadn't penetrated the tender meat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Carrie highly recommended the red bean puffs (HK$70), which were very good. Our main waiter was also friendly and attentive.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Qi House of Sichuan, 2/F J Senses, 60 Johnson Road, Wan Chai.
