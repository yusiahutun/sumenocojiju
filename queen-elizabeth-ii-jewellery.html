It was designed for Queen Victoria in 1839 by Rundell, Bridge and Rundell – then the royal jewellers – and it is a fascinating amalgam of British monarchical history. Among its treasures are the St Edwards sapphire, Queen Elizabeth I’s pearl earrings, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/jewellery-watches/a41212568/queen-elizabeth-black-princes-ruby-imperial-state-crown/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Black Prince’s ruby" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Black Prince’s ruby</a>, the Stuart sapphire, and the gargantuan Cullinan II diamond – one of two major stones cut from the largest gem-quality diamond ever found (the second sits atop the sovereign’s sceptre and cross). Re-made by George VI in 1937, by royal jewellers Garrard, in order to make it lighter, the crown nonetheless still weighed more than 1kg when the Queen wore it.</p><img alt="imperial state crown" title="The Coffin Carrying Queen Elizabeth II Is Transferred From Buckingham Palace To The Palace Of Westminster" width=3840 height=2560 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-gun-carriage-bearing-the-coffin-of-the-late-queen-news-photo-1663163129.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Pool</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was a moment of great solemnity; full of ceremony and ritual. As ever, the Queen had the correct regalia for the moment. "The Queen knew – and said so – that crowns are important," says Joanna Hardy, jewellery historian and curator at vintage jewellery destination Omneque. "The fact that it is on her coffin now speaks volumes."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If the Crown Jewels speak to the royal ancestry of this remarkable woman, so much of Elizabeth’s private jewellery spoke to who she was as a woman, a wife, a mother, a daughter and granddaughter. For her last ceremonial appearance, she will be outwardly draped in regalia, but what jewellery she wears within, will no doubt be innately personal.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Elizabeth’s private jewellery collection spoke to who she was as a woman, a wife, a mother, a daughter<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Queen Elizabeth II: A Timeline" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/qe2-obit-thumb-1662658985.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Crown Jewels are kept in the Jewel Room in the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/g39924619/queen-fashion-shoot-tower-of-london/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tower of London" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Tower of London</a> and comprise of 142 pieces of regalia with 23,578 polished gemstones. The Queen’s personal jewellery collection is less distinct: a coterie of brooches, necklaces and tiaras inherited from grandmothers and aunts one likes to imagine she kept hidden away in old sock drawers (we doubt it). This collection is, however, no less impressive and overflows as much with global history as it does familial anecdote, as can be expected when your family is no ‘ordinary’ family.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>The family jewellery</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Most of these pieces snake a line between fascinating artefacts of history and familial sentiment. The Prince Albert Brooch has been worn Queens Alexandra, Mary, Elizabeth and Elizabeth II, and was first given to Queen Victoria by Prince Albert the day before her wedding. She loved it so much that she wore it on her wedding day. The Queen’s Oriental Circlet Tiara, a beloved favourite of her own mother, was initially also designed by Prince Albert for Queen Victoria, in 1853. It was originally set with opals, but Victoria replaced them as she thought them to be unlucky; replacing them with rubies.</p><img alt="the queen mother wearing the oriental circlet tiara" title="The Queen Mother wearing the Oriental Circlet Tiara" width=2400 height=2780 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-514689318-1663231656.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bettmann</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>The Queen Mother wearing the Oriental Circlet Tiara</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Much of the collection, the Queen inherited from her jewellery-obsessed grandmother Queen Mary. One of the most recognisable of her tiaras, (spot it on your notes, coins and stamps) is officially known as The Girls of Great Britain and Ireland Tiara, as it was presented to the then-Duchess of York as a wedding gift. Yet the Queen has always lovingly referred to it as ‘Granny’s Tiara’. It is perhaps one of the most touching examples of how Elizabeth’s two sides intersected in her jewels – a tiara known as a shorthand for royalty, was simply known to her as her 'Granny’s'.</p><img alt="the queen in ’granny’s tiara’" title="The Queen in ’Granny’s Tiara’" width=4500 height=3017 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-478294780-1-1663231857.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Sean Gallup</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>The Queen in ’Granny’s Tiara’</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Queen Mary’s collection was vast and intriguing. One of her more interesting pieces was the Vladimir Tiara, made for the Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, wife of Grand Duke Vladimir, who fled to Britain following the Russian Revolution. One of Russia’s most senior nobles, she hid her jewels in a secret compartment in her St Petersburg palace. Later that year, a British officer dressed as a worker went and retrieved them for her and, when her jewels were subsequently auctioned off after her death in 1920, Queen Mary bought the smuggled tiara herself.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Mary had pearl drops inserted and made them interchangeable with emeralds she already owned. When the Queen inherited this tiara, she was seen wearing it all three ways – pearls, emeralds and plain diamonds. This tweaking of jewellery was typical of Mary, who frequently dismantled pieces she had herself inherited, or had them copied. The Queen Alexandra Kokoshnik Tiara, made by Garrard in 1888, to celebrate the then-Princess of Wales’ silver wedding anniversary, was inspired by a traditional Kokoshnik Russian headpiece and the tiara worn by her sister, Empress Marie Feodorovna of Russia. It was passed to Queen Mary who had another version made in 1919, which was known as the Queen Mary Diamond Fringe Tiara. This was passed on to the Queen Mother who lent it to the Queen on her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/jewellery-watches/g40142226/bridal-earrings/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wedding day" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">wedding day</a> and it became part of one of the Queen’s best jewellery stories.</p><img alt="the queen wearing the queen alexandra kokoshnik tiara" title="The Queen wearing the Queen Alexandra Kokoshnik Tiara" width=2490 height=3616 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-81075771-1663232040.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Anwar Hussein Collection</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>The Queen wearing the Queen Alexandra Kokoshnik Tiara</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“My favourite piece is her wedding tiara, the Queen Mary Fringe Tiara,” says Elizabeth Holmes, author of HRH: So Many Thoughts on Royal Style. “It broke on her wedding day, when they were attaching the veil, which caused quite the stir. Her mother assured then-Princess Elizabeth that there were others she could use, but a jeweller was called in to fix the original choice. I love that you can see a tiny imperfection in the very top in her wedding pics. What’s even more special is that the Queen loaned it to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/celebrities/news/a34402539/princess-beatrice-honour-wear-queens-dress-wedding/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Princess Beatrice" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Princess Beatrice</a>, for her own wedding day in 2020.”</p><img alt="queen wedding day" title="Queen wedding day" width=3000 height=4000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/16/21/1464351313-queen-wedding-day.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Loaning the jewellery</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Queen famously loaned her jewellery on many occasions. The Lover’s Knot Tiara, was initially made for Queen Mary by Garrard, from stones used on her wedding day. It was loaned to Diana as a wedding gift from the Queen and has frequently been seen on Kate, the new Princess of Wales. Kate also famously borrowed The Cartier Halo Tiara, made from diamonds and platinum, on her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/bazaar-brides/g36285845/kate-middleton-prince-william-royal-wedding-hidden-meanings/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wedding day" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">wedding day</a>. It was originally purchased by George VI for his wife, the Queen’s mother.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Queen Mary’s Diamond bandeau is a stunning Art Deco piece which holds a diamond brooch at its centre, originally a wedding present in 1893 for Queen Mary who – in typical fashion – repurposed it into a tiara. Rarely seen, it had its moment in the spotlight recently, when Meghan wore it for her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/hair/a20752705/royal-wedding-meghan-markle-hairstyle/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="2018 wedding" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">2018 wedding</a> to Prince Harry.</p><img alt="cambridge lovers knot princess diana kate middleton" title="cambridge lovers knot princess diana kate middleton" width=1000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/cambridge-lovers-knot-princess-diana-kate-middleton-1550012277.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Diana and Kate wearing the Lovers Knot Tiara</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Since Queen Mary’s glittering spending sprees, the royals have actually rarely purchased new jewels. In fact, when Charles purchased Diana’s now famous sapphire and diamond ring from Garrard in 1981, it caused quite a stir for being a ‘new’ piece.</p><img alt="meghan markle wedding tiara" title="Meghan Markle wedding tiara" width=1926 height=3024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/meghan-markle-wedding-tiara-1648805238.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">JONATHAN BRADY</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Meghan wearing Queen Mary’s diamond bandeau tiara</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Most of the new additions to the royal jewellery collection in recent decades have been gifts, not purchases,” says royal jewellery expert Ella Kay. “When royals have added new pieces themselves, they have occasionally acquired antique jewels, but more frequently they have had existing pieces dismantled and remodelled – a strategy that began with Queen Mary, more than a century ago, who loved to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/jewellery-watches/a38894049/how-to-repurpose-jewellery/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="rework and renovate her existing jewels" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">rework and renovate her existing jewels</a> to keep up with current styles and trends.”</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though loaded with sentiment, it does, of course, chime with our increasing interest in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/sustainability/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=sustainability class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">sustainability</a>, and our ever-shifting views on the monarchy itself. “Today’s royal family needs to be both aspirational and accessible, fancy yet frugal, which means big jewel moments are few and far between,” says Holmes. “Think of how rare it is to see Catherine in a tiara, whereas the Queen, and Diana, used to wear them quite a lot. When they do, it’s nice to see them play around with existing jewels. It’s super sustainable, which is obviously a big issue for both the new King Charles and his heir, William.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Today’s royal family needs to be both aspirational and accessible, fancy yet frugal – big jewellery moments are rare<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><img alt="catherine wearing the cartier halo tiara" title="Catherine wearing the Cartier Halo Tiara" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/ghk.h-cdn.co/assets/17/37/kate-middleton-wedding-dress-hip-padding.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Kate wearing the Cartier Halo Tiara</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"There really is no need for them to buy new pieces, when they have such a vast collection," says Hardy. "But they also know it would send out a very bad message if they did." She goes on to explain that any new pieces commissioned, were done with meaning and special intent. The last piece commissioned for the Queen was done by the Goldsmith's Company just this year, to honour her Platinum Jubilee. The Queen selected the design, by British designer David Marshall, and wore it to the lighting of the Beacons.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The Queen was not into 'brands' or fashion in that sense," Hardy explains. "She was very much about championing craftsmanship and individual makers, particularly in Britain." The brooch – the last piece made for the Queen, will be on rare public display at the upcoming Goldsmiths’ Fair (27 Sep-9 Oct) in tribute to the late monarch.</p><img alt="the queen wearing her platinum jubilee commissioned brooch by david marshall" title="The Queen wearing her Platinum Jubilee-commissioned brooch by David Marshall" width=1512 height=2440 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1663240703.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Pool</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>The Queen wearing her Platinum Jubilee-commissioned brooch by David Marshall</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>The symbolism behind the jewellery</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Queen frequently used her jewellery to convey messages. Some of the most blatant examples of this are, of course, her Crown Jewels, which are purposefully loaded with meaning. The George IV State Diadem was worn by the Queen to the opening of parliament and other major affairs, including on the way to her coronation in 1953. It was made in 1820 for George IV’s coronation by Rundell, Bridge & Rundell, designed with the rose of England, thistle of Scotland and shamrock of Ireland.</p><img alt="queen elizabeth ii" title="Queen Elizabeth II " width=2341 height=2945 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/london-england-queen-elizabeth-ii-26-years-young-is-news-photo-1662735472.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bettmann</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>The Queen wearing the George IV State Diadem</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>The Queen understood that her jewellery could often speak louder than words<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Queen would famously wear symbols in her jewellery for meeting foreign dignitaries, for royal visits to Commonwealth nations or to mark special occasions. One great example is the Maple Leaf Brooch, given by George VI to his wife in 1939 to mark their state visit to Canada. The Queen Mother was very attached to the piece, which she wore until her death at 100 and, after the Queen inherited it, she has since loaned it to Camilla and Kate for their respective tours of Canada. "The Queen understood that her jewellery could often speak louder than words," says Hardy. "For that reason, everything she wore was very carefully thought out."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">These messages were sometimes – in keeping with the Queen’s famous sense of humour – cheeky. Much comment was made about the subtle middle-finger given to President Trump on his visit to the Queen in 2018 through the medium of… brooches. On the first day of his trip, she wore a simple green brooch given to her by the Obamas, on the second, a gift from Trump’s other foe at the time, Canada. Coded messages were often assumed to be written into her wardrobe, not least the first state opening of parliament after Brexit, when the Queen – famously thought of, though of course, never confirmed, a ‘Remainer’ – wore a hat which looked like the European flag.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, many of these messages were simply symbols of meaning and sentiment personal to Elizabeth herself. Her signature pearls were a gift from her father, who gave her her first necklace when she was three, and added two pearls for every birthday she had. She was rarely seen without them. Her so-called ‘Honeymoon Brooch’ – a chrysanthemum-inspired diamond design – was given to her before her wedding, and worn in her official honeymoon portraits with Philip, and again when the couple recreated the shot in 2020, for their 73-third wedding anniversary.</p><img alt="prince philip funeral arrangements" title="Prince Philip funeral arrangements" width=3476 height=2731 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/queen-prince-philip-funeral-1618046092.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Topical Press Agency</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>The Queen first wearing her Honeymoon Brooch</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“She always selected pieces with personal meaning,” says Holmes. “To Philip’s memorial service earlier this year, she wore the “Scarab” brooch, a modern ruby piece designed by Andrew Grima, which he had given her in 1966.
