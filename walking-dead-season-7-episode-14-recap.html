Payne <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a41300/tom-payne-walking-dead-jesus/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said last year" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">said last year</a> that he saw no reason why his on-screen Jesus wouldn't be gay, as he is in the comics, and in tonight's episode "The Other Side," he officially became the show's third major gay character.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="p1 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Between the fact that Jesus is an elusive and taciturn guy to begin with, and the fact that these characters are living in fear of a fascist dictator during a zombie apocalypse, it's no surprise that it took a while for the subject to come up. But Jesus knows who he is – he's one of the more self-possessed characters in the cast – and there is no dramatic "coming out" moment here, during a moment of bonding between Jesus and Maggie.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="p1 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During the same conversation, we learn Jesus grew up in a group home, and has never felt like he belonged anywhere until now. He's always had a hard time getting close to anyone, he says, "neighbors, friends, boyfriends…" Maggie tells him he should try it sometime. Jesus/Daryl shippers, start your engines. (I'm semi-kidding, but they do share a scene together later in the episode and i could almost hear the GIFs being made in light of this new revelation.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="p1 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Walking Dead has gone from having zero LGBT representation in its early years to a fairly strong track record in recent seasons, with Aaron (Ross Marquand) and his boyfriend Eric (Jordan Woods-Robinson) sharing a kiss that <a data-external=true data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/24/walking-dead-gay-kiss-fans_n_6746762.html " data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="angered plenty of bigots" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">angered plenty of bigots</a> two years back. Aaron and Eric are still around, but the show's major lesbian character Tara (Alanna Masterson) wasn't so lucky. Her girlfriend Denise (Merritt Wever) was controversially killed off in what became part of a <a data-external=true href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/bury-your-gays-why-100-877176 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="troubling TV trend" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">troubling TV trend</a> last year; an unwelcome resurgence of the "Bury Your Gays" trope which <a data-external=true href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://variety.com/2016/tv/opinion/the-100-lexa-jason-rothenberg-1201729110/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="came to a head" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">came to a head</a> with a profoundly controversial storyline on The CW's The 100.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="p1 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But the fact that this is now a show with three gay characters in its main cast matters. Given his status as a badass fan favorite, his significant role in the comics and the bonds he's developed with several of the show's main characters, the now-openly-gay Jesus has the potential to become genuinely iconic in a way Aaron and Tara are not. Gay characters on television are no longer uncommon, but gay male heroes on action-led genre shows are, and the fact that The Walking Dead has an <a data-external=true data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2016/07/20/republicans-and-democrats-agree-on-the-walking-dead-but-not-game-of-thrones/ " data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="unusually bipartisan fan base" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">unusually bipartisan fan base</a> with a strong Republican contingent makes its sexual diversity all the more charged.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="p1 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"In my opinion there should be more awesome gay people in fiction because there are plenty of awesome gay people in real life," Robert Kirkman, who created The Walking Dead comics and is an EP on the show, <a data-external=true href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20u6xf/im_robert_kirkman_creator_of_the_walking_dead_ama/cg6rq5f/?context=3" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said last year" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">said last year</a>. "I want Jesus to be a character where his sexuality is as unimportant as Rick or other heterosexual characters. So we won't focus on it constantly and it won't be the focus of any big storylines for him... but he'll make it with a dude every now and then... before going out and drop kicking zombies."
