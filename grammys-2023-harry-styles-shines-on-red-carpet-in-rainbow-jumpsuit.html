His look was custom-made in collaboration with Swarovski, using 250,000 crystals in nine different colors. Styles went shirtless beneath the rainbow-colored jumpsuit, which was handmade in Paris and took over 150 hours of work.</p><p>Styles is <a href=#>nominated in six categories</a> at Sunday’s ceremony, including both Song of the Year and Record of the Year for “As It Was.” His third studio album, Harry’s House, is up for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album. The Dunkirk star also has the chance to take home Best Pop Solo Performance and Best Music Video. In the latter category, <a href=#>he faces competition from ex-girlfriend</a> <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a> for All Too Well: The Short Film.</p><p>When he collected the Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Album — defeating <a href=#><strong>Adele</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Lizzo</strong></a> and more — he switched to white jacket paired with a sparkly silver top and flared pants.</p><p>The Recording Academy confirmed on January 29 that <a href=#>the former One Direction member</a> would be taking the Grammys stage to perform again following <a href=#>his show-stopping rendition of “Watermelon Sugar”</a> in 2021. At the 63rd annual event, <a href=#>Styles rocked an all-leather look</a> — with his bare chest exposed beneath his suit jacket.</p><p>Styles’ red carpet appearance on Sunday marked <a href=#>his first major awards show</a> since his split from <a href=#><strong>Olivia Wilde</strong></a>. Us Weekly confirmed in November 2022 that the pair — who <a href=#>sparked a romance in 2021</a> while working together on Don’t Worry Darling — <a href=#>called it quits</a> after nearly two years of dating.</p><p>“Olivia is still very much upset about the breakup,” a source exclusively told Us of the Booksmart director, 38, one month later.</p><p>At the time, the House alum was “leaning on friends” for support and “trying to move on.” According to the insider, “Dating isn’t on her list of priorities.”</p><p>Styles, meanwhile, has been hard at work in the wake of the breakup. The “Golden” crooner returned to Los Angeles in January to perform <a href=#>previously postponed Love On Tour residency concerts</a> at the Kia Forum. He became the first artist in history to <a href=#>finish 15 sold-out gigs</a> at both Madison Square Garden and the Forum.</p><p>The X Factor UK alum previously <a href=#>took home the Best Pop Solo Performance trophy</a> for “Watermelon Sugar” at the 2021 Grammy Awards. That year, he also earned nods for Best Music Video for “Adore You” and Best Pop Vocal Album for Fine Line.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Wow, to everyone who made this record with me, thank you so much,” he gushed during his acceptance speech, which was censored as he gave shout-outs to his fellow nominees. “I’m really grateful to be here. All of these songs are f–king massive, so thank you so much. I feel honored to be around all of you so thank you so much.”</p><p>Scroll down for a closer look of Styles at the 2023 Grammys:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bcv6K5zLKqZmpgZ4ButMCrqbJlo6nGrbHSZqqhoZ6awG67zWapnpxdmK6zvMStZKKmXaeuqrrBqK5moqWivbTByK1m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
