Inside Their Relationship</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-06-16</div><p>Folks have been welcoming <a href=#><strong>Savannah Guthrie</strong></a> into their home on Today since 2012 and have watched her become a mom to <a href=#>Vale and ​Charley</a>. Savannah and her husband, <a href=#><strong>Mike Feldman</strong></a>, struggled with getting pregnant, and she’s been open about the challenges she faced. But now, people are curious to learn more about her children.</p><h2>Who Is Savannah Guthrie’s Daughter Vale?</h2><p>Vale is Savannah’s first child. She was born in August 2014 and she weighed 8 pounds, 5 ounces. Vale <a href=#>hangs out with <strong>Jenna Bush Hager’s</strong> children</a>, Mila, Poppy and Hal, and the Today moms often post photos of their kids having playdates.</p><p>Like thousands of other little girls, Vale is a big <strong>Taylor Swift</strong> fan. Savannah shared pictures of her and Vale’s friendship bracelets after <a href=#>attending Taylor’s Eras tour</a> in August 2023. A few weeks later Vale joined her mom in front of the cameras as Savannah dressed as Taylor and the two performed to some of Taylor’s most popular songs.</p><h2>Vale Values Religion Like Savannah Guthrie</h2><p>Savannah’s book, <a href=#>Mostly What God Does: Reflections on Seeking and Finding His Love Everywhere</a>, was released in February 2024. In it, she discusses her children’s relationship with religion and touches on Vale’s baptism explaining that she was “so excited” to ​experience the religious rite.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/savannah-guthrie-daughter-vale.jpg><p>“She said, ‘Today, God, I joined your family.’ And that gives me a lot of joy,” Savannah told <a href=#>Today</a> on February 20, 2024.</p><h2>Savannah Guthrie Gushes Often About Becoming a Mom to Vale</h2><p>Savannah was so excited about the birth of Vale that she called into Today right after giving birth to share the good news.</p><p>“I feel like life just started,” Savannah said when she called into <a href=#>Today</a> after Vale’s birth. “I can’t get over the joy that she brings — it’s kind of inexpressible. Honestly, I think it is beyond words.”</p><p>In 2018, Today celebrated the moms on the show in the days leading up to Mother’s Day. Savannah spoke about her experiencing motherhood for the first time to Today ​coanchor <strong>Hoda Kotb</strong> in 2018 and mentioned the fact that she became a mom later in life. Savannah was 42 when she gave birth to Vale. However, that didn’t stop her from being slightly terrified at the idea of bringing a baby home.</p><p>“I was shocked when we went home with her,” Savannah explained. “I’m like, ‘You’re just going to let us take her home/ Was there any kind of manual?’ But those moments I can remember being cheek to cheek, the tears rolling down and just having a little conversation with her like, ‘I’m always going to love you. I’m always going to protect you. I’m always going to be your mommy.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn6hlmah6tK3VmqWnmZhitLbAx6ugnqtdma62s8etnKtlppa5pnnMnpytZZiav26vx6KjnWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
