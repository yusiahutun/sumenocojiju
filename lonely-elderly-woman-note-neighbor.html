Sadly, people often overlook the reality that many elderly people live alone, and that isolation can lead to crippling loneliness and sadness. Marleen Brooks of California was reminded of this when she came home to find a heart-wrenching letter from her 90-year-old neighbor, whom she'd never spoken to before.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">The elderly woman had reached out to her to confess that she was extremely lonely, asking if the two of them could be friends. The note read:</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"Would you consider to become my friend. I'm 90 years old - live alone. All my friends have passed away.

Makes my heart sad, but on the bright side it looks like I will be getting a new friend."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">So what did she do next? Of course, she went over and introduced herself to her elderly neighbor, Wanda, cupcakes in hand. "She's such a sweet lady! And she was over the moon when we came over," Marleen later told the news anchor, who <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.facebook.com/FrankSomervilleKTVU/posts/1467389743324348 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="posted the update" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">posted the update</a>. During their visit, Wanda opened up to Marleen about her perpetual isolation and how happy she was to meet her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"I hope you didn't think I was stupid for writing you, but I had to do something," Wanda told her, according to Marleen. "Thank you so much for coming over. I've lived here for 50 years and don't know any of my neighbors."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">[facebook ]<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.facebook.com/FrankSomervilleKTVU/posts/1467389743324348 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=https://www.facebook.com/FrankSomervilleKTVU/posts... class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">https://www.facebook.com/FrankSomervilleKTVU/posts...</a>data-width="800"[/facebook]</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Wanda has three sons, and one of them passed away from cancer last year, she told Marleen. The other two live far away, so she rarely sees them. Wanda is on oxygen and has congestive heart failure and osteoporosis, among other ailments. The link between extreme isolation and physical health in the elderly has been well-documented; a 2008 study found that lonely older adults were 45 percent more likely to die than those who had meaningful connections with others, reported <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/18/the-high-price-of-loneliness/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The New York Times" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">The New York Times</a> in 2012.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Having someone around makes all the difference in the world, even if it seems like a small thing to stop by and just say hi to that elderly neighbor down the street. "There are so many others out there who are lonely just like Wanda," the news anchor reminded his audience in the post. "I would ask that maybe you consider knocking on their door and saying hi. I know it would mean the world to them."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">And as for Marleen and Wanda?
