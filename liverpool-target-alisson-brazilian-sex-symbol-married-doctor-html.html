He had already made his debut for Brazil's first team and won the U20 Toulon tournament in 2013. But the fine form of Wojciech Szczesny stunted his progress.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Pole was Roma's starting keeper, and although Alisson played in cup competitions, he was frustrated at his lack of league minutes. He later confessed that he considered leaving the Giallorossi, but Szczesny's move to Juventus last summer was a turning point.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Alisson was one of Roma's standouts in 2017-18. It was a season of transition with key players leaving or retiring, particularly Francesco Totti and Mohamed Salah, plus a new coach in Eusebio Di Francesco.</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/17/15/4E4F0FD900000578-0-image-m-106_1531838222152.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Liverpool in advanced talks with Roma over £62m deal for...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/18/10/4E5DB7CE00000578-0-image-m-26_1531905361539.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Liverpool new boy Xherdan Shaqiri meets Naby Keita, Virgil...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/18/09/4E5D5B5500000578-0-image-m-19_1531903917421.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>'Your hate makes me unstopable': Liverpool striker Rhian...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/18/07/4E3D4C7F00000578-0-image-m-14_1531897084581.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Daniel Sturridge will stay and fight for his place at...</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span> <span>4.4k</span> shares<p class=mol-para-with-font>But the capital outfit had a campaign to remember, reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League for the first time since 1984. Alisson was a crucial component. His courage and reflexes made him unbeatable at times.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He was particularly impressive against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, and was a wall dressed in black when Roma won 4-2 at Napoli in March. Despite his broad, 6ft 3in build, Alisson is extremely agile and springy. He regularly makes the first save from a powerful shot, and then bounces back into action to deny the follow up.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That comes partly from natural athleticism, but also tireless work on the training ground. The Selecao star also possess a surprising array of samba skills with his feet. He became a cult figure at the Stadio Olimpico for his ability to extricate himself from tight spots without using his hands.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>We are not talking Lionel Messi-style dribbles or Zinedine Zidane pirouettes, but his ability and confidence to manoeuvre away from on-rushing forwards became a real crowd-pleaser.

He enjoys playing the guitar and listens to sertaneja music (a folk style with rural origins). He drinks chimarrao tea - a favourite among the South American players. Last season was only his first as a starting keeper in Europe, so it's too early to put him alongside Taffarel, Dida and Cesar. But I think he can become a leader.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Last time Liverpool plundered the Eternal City it was a resounding success.
