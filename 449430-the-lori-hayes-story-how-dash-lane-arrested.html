She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was born</a> in 1974 in Indianapolis, Indiana, the United States of America. Her <a href=#>family</a> moved to Kentucky, where she grew up.</p><p class=align-left>Lori then attended Tates Creek High School and was admitted to Kentucky University. After graduating with a degree in social work from the University of Kentucky, she married Brad Hayes and moved to Springfield, Illinois.</p><p class=align-left>Once she settled in the new locality, she started looking for a job and got one in the Illinois Kid Care Program. And it was not long after settling down, they got their first child in 1999, whom they named Alexis.</p><p class=align-left>However, things were not always smooth for Lori and Brad Hayes, as those who were close to them stated that their marriage started having problems after they got their first child.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/33f97f22390860f3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Kathy Woodhouse? Story, trial, arrests</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Brad's job made him travel a lot, and he was not around that much. It is most likely why Lori was alone when she <a href=#>was murdered</a>.</p><h2>How did Lori Hayes die?</h2><p class=align-left>What did Lori Hayes' obituary state as her cause of death? For the story to make sense, it must start at the beginning.</p><p class=align-left>It was just a regular day for Lori Hayes with her husband, Brad Hayes, with whom they had a 9-month-old daughter out of town. Brad's work made him <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">often travel</a> for days at a time, and that was the case on the fateful August 1, 1999.</p><p class=align-left>Also, Lori's mother was not around, having left her earlier in the day to return to Kentucky after a short visit. After her mother left, Lori thought of going out shopping with her beautiful 9-month-old baby.</p><p class=align-left>However, something happened after she left home, and it took a call from people outside the theatre to raise suspicion. They were surprised to hear a baby crying alone in a hot car. They notified the police, who rushed to the scene immediately.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6c7dc028956d79eb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jana Reynolds's story: What really happened and latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Since the police had no idea what they were dealing with, they ran the car's number plates to determine the owner. They found out the owner of the car was Lori and Brad Hayes.</p><p class=align-left>However, there was something weird about the car. Lori's purse was still inside, and there were also specks of blood near the trunk. And, of course, investigators concluded that they were dealing with something more than an abandoned child.</p><p class=align-left>On top of the blood, police found a spent shell casing at the back of the car, and they hoped the worst had not happened. And the search for Lori Hayes ensued. It ended when they found her body in a cornfield southwest of Springfield the following day.</p><p class=align-left>Lori died from a single gunshot wound to the back of her head. Also, the autopsy results showed that she was raped as semen was collected from her body.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ffeb64753765ffa7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Donnah Winger murder case: What happened to convict Mark Winger?</span></p></a><h2>How did they find Lori’s body?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d7cbb9e440b37ced.jpg><p class=align-left>The immediate response for <a href=#>police officers</a> after suspecting something had happened to the mother of the abandoned child was to head to their home. They arrived home and found Brad already there after returning from his business trip.</p><p class=align-left>According to Brad, he left immediately to play basketball with friends and returned home later. As is with such cases, the police considered him a person of interest, but no evidence tied him to the case, and they continued searching for Lori as time was going fast.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, a witness' statement made detectives more suspicious of Brad. The witness stated that they had spotted someone wearing a baseball cap driving the car near the mall. However, the findings were not sufficient to provide any new leads. As a result, brad was asked to provide his DNA, which he did.</p><p class=align-left>So, how did the police discover Lori's body? It was a chance encounter from the curiosity of a police officer on patrol. While doing his regular rounds, the police officer discovered fresh tracks on an area of a cornfield and chose to follow them. After several yards, he came across a body later confirmed to be Lori Hayes.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/913105aae327eaf6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Curtis Reeves?

And after conducting DNA tests, Lori's husband was dropped as a suspect. So it was now the investigator's job to find the killer.</p><p class=align-left>Another case led detectives to find Lori’s killer. A <a href=#>real estate</a> agent reported a rape incident, and after police officers arrested the culprit and did DNA tests, they proved that he was the primary suspect.</p><p class=align-left>The police developed a composite sketch of the perpetrator that brought them closer to solving the case. The fortunate thing is that a lady working at a <a href=#>security</a> company recognized the person in the sketch and believed it was her co-worker, Dale Lash.</p><p class=align-left>Police called in Dale Lash's brother, who identified the voice in the recording secured by police as his brother.
