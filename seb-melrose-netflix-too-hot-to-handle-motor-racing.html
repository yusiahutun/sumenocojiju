The 25-year-old, who last appeared at the Ginetta GT4 Supercup in 2021, found a new audience when he starred on Netflix hit Too Hot To Handle.
He came runner-up with now 'longterm' love Kayla Richart - scoring plenty of fans and admirers, as well as earning a huge social media following.
That makes Melrose a more attractive proposition for manufacturers now, as they look to bring sponsors in and he looks for a drive this season."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I can still peddle a car.

She was the girl I fancied and I felt there was a connection there, just like the other guys.</p><p>"But I wasn't biggest guy there, I didn't have the biggest muscles, and wasn't the tallest.
