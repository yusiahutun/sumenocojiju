Lawrence, the British army officer who led the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Turkish empire during the First World War. The role had been turned down by Marlon Brando and Finney.</span></p><p><span>The four-hour epic, which took two years to make and also starred Omar Sharif, turned him into a household name – and he bought a white Rolls-Royce with his wages.</span></p><p><span>The epic earned him the first of eight Best Actor Oscar nominations – though he never won. He received an honorary Oscar in 2003, having initially turned it down.</span></p><p><span>In a letter, O’Toole asked the&nbsp; Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to delay the award&nbsp; until he was 80, saying he was ‘still in the game and might win the&nbsp; bugger outright’.</span></p><p><span>But when he finally clasped his statuette, he said: ‘Always a bridesmaid, never a bride, my foot.’</span></p><p><span>He was nominated again in&nbsp; 2006 for his role as a lecherous old actor in the British comedy drama Venus, which also starred Leslie Phillips.</span></p><br><p><b><span>20 per cent of his wealth has gone to his 14-year-old granddaughter Jessica - </span><span>along with his Mini Cooper</span></b></p><p><span>O’Toole had a reputation for riotous behaviour and brawling following bouts of drinking during his younger days.</span></p><p><span>But he was forced to give up alcohol after he had most of his stomach and his pancreas removed in 1976.</span></p><p><span>The surgery left him as an insulin-dependent diabetic, and he then nearly died from a blood disorder in 1978. His 20-year marriage to Ms Phillips, which ended in divorce in 1979, was once one of the most famous couplings in the theatrical world, rivalled only by that of Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor.<br></span></p><p><span>Ms Phillips revealed in two biographies that he had subjected her to mental cruelty, largely fuelled by heavy drinking, and was subject to bouts of extreme jealousy after she left him for a younger lover.</span></p><p><span>O’Toole finally announced his retirement from acting after a&nbsp; 50-year career in July 2012, announcing that it was time ‘to chuck in&nbsp; the sponge’.</span></p><p><span>Prime Minister David Cameron paid tribute to him after his death, praising his ‘stunning’ performance in Lawrence of Arabia which he described as his ‘favourite film’.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Fd4WXbm9tZ4Cawaa%2BjIiLqKecmsBugMxmpLKrpJq%2FunnLnp2tZZ%2Bjsm6vx6KjnWVxmMGwvtJmm7Khnpx6uLXSoZysZXGowKq%2F05qlrWViZX1ufI9pZJ2ZpZy1tbHRZoKarJVifm59zGaqqKZdgbyzr8CnZHBuYGJ9cXyMnZiun5ipsrN5r5qrq6GTnq5ufI2hq6ak</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
