A look into her family background</h2><p><strong>Full name</strong>: Blake Ellender Lively</p><p><strong>Hometown</strong>: Los Angeles, California</p><p><strong>Relationship status</strong>: Married to Ryan Reynolds</p><p><strong>Birthday</strong>: August 25, 1987</p><p>Born to Elaine and Ernie Lively in Los Angeles, Blake was destined for a career in entertainment as her late father was an actor while her mom was a talent scout. The 35-year-old has four other siblings – Eric, Lori, Robyn, and Jason – all of who are also actors.</p><p>Blake was exposed to the acting world when she attended her parents’ acting classes; it subsequently led to her first role as Bridget in The Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants, during which her real father, Ernie, played her on-screen dad.</p><p>It secured her as an up-and-coming teen star, making her the perfect candidate to portray Gossip Girl’s It girl, Serena Van Der Woodsen.</p><p>The actress has appeared in at least 18 films in her career, but most have not been commercial successes. Blake’s most notable film to date was 2016’s survival film, The Shallows, which grossed about $119 million against a modest $17 million production budget.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Blake Lively’s net worth is less than one-tenth of Ryan Reynolds’</h2><p>She has an estimated net worth of $30 million, while her husband <a href=#>Ryan Reynolds</a> has a $350 million fortune. That is expected since Blake only appeared in about one film per year and has taken a step back from her career in the last three.</p><p>Ryan, meanwhile, has released back-to-back films since 2008. In 2021 alone, Reynolds starred in three films: Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard, Free Guy, and Red Notice.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Blake is mom to four kids</h2><p>After over one decade of marriage, Blake and Ryan can officially proclaim themselves as couple goals. The stars met on the set of Green Lantern in 2011 and are now parents to four children.</p><p>They have three daughters called James, Inez, and Betty. Blake gave birth to their fourth child in early 2023 but the gender and name have yet to be publically revealed.</p><p>Our favorite Blake and Ryan moments are their loving birthday tributes where they hilariously troll each other instead on <a href=#>Instagram</a> and Twitter.</p><p>Before crossing paths with Reynolds, Blake dated his Gossip Girl co-star, Penn Badgley, for three years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Her It Ends With Us casting has fans underwhelmed</h2><p>Expect to see Blake return to screens as Lily Bloom from the Colleen Hoover’s New York Times Best Seller, It Ends With Us.</p><p>If you haven’t read the book, it’s a romance novel that revolves around Lily, who has moved to a new city and falls in love with a man named Ryle Kincaid.</p><p>The novel was released in 2016 but received renewed attention thanks to the power of social media. The success is a double-edged sword as critics accuse Hoover of romanticizing abusive relationships.</p><p>That’s not the only issue surrouding Lively’s new film. Fans were left disappointed by Blake and Justin Baldoni’s casting since they are both significantly older than the book characters.</p><p>Lily is described as a 23-year-old fresh college graduate, while Ryle is a 30-year-old neurosurgeon. In reality, Blake is 35 and Justin is 39.</p><p>The author defended that she opted to age the characters since was “contracted” to write about younger characters at the time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-isn-t-a-drinker-but-she-founded-an-alcohol-brand>She isn’t a drinker but she founded an alcohol brand</h2><p>The mom of four raised eyebrows in June 2023 with the release of her gourmet sparkling canned cocktail line, Betty Buzz. The low alcohol drinks has landed the <a href=#>celebrity</a> in hot water since is not a drinker herself.</p><p>“Drinking isn’t my thing,” she wrote on Instagram. “But for f*** sake, flavor is. Homemade recipes. Real fruit. Real ingredients. Quality booze. No crap. Also a real time saver. Which is why I really did.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Blake Lively’s Met Gala looks never disappoint</h2><p>Her new cocktails may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but one thing’s for sure – her <a href=#>Met Gala</a> style never goes wrong.</p><p>Since her 2008 debut, she has slowly become a must-see star, often coordinating with the gala’s color scheme.</p><p><strong>2008 </strong>– Ralph Lauren</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/06/GettyImages-81489693-672x1024.jpg><p><strong>2011 </strong>– Chanel</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/06/GettyImages-113511994-682x1024.jpg><p><strong>2014 </strong>– Gucci</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/06/GettyImages-492355719-736x1024.jpg><p><strong>2017 </strong>– Atelier Versace</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/06/GettyImages-676053188-764x1024.jpg><p><strong>2018 </strong>– Versace</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/06/GettyImages-956933436-1024x800.jpg><p><strong>2022 </strong>– Atelier Versace</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/06/GettyImages-1240424641-1024x683.jpg><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlvX2WAcLXNrKCdnV2XuaK3xGajoq6Voca0ecuinZ5lp57BqXnRspinZaKaxq%2B7y52qZp6fqr%2B1tIybmJuxXam8brzUm6Oim12fvKyx0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
