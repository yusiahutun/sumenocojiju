Now that the album is finally here, we learn from the track "Free Woman" that the pain she referred to also includes surviving sexual assault.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I was sexually assaulted by a music producer," Gaga said in an interview with Zane Lowe for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://music.apple.com/us/album/chromatica/1500951604 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Apple Music" data-vars-ga-product-id=ae56eb41-a0e6-4832-a444-78ba5716450a data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://music.apple.com/us/album/chromatica/1500951604 data-product-url=https://music.apple.com/us/album/chromatica/1500951604 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fchromatica%2F1500951604" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=a21c8680-23aa-41ac-9a1e-aeb0190be1db class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Apple Music</a>, while explaining the song. "It's compounded all of my feelings about life, feelings about the world, feelings about the industry, what I had to compromise and go through to get to where I am. And I had to put it there. And when I was able to finally celebrate it, I said, 'You know what? I'm not nothing without a steady hand. I'm not nothing unless I know I can. I'm still something If I don't got a man, I'm a free woman.'</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It's me going, 'I'm no longer going to define myself as a survivor, or a victim of sexual assault. I just am a person that is free, who went through some fucked-up shit."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gaga has been a vocal advocate for sexual assault survivors. She also co-wrote the Oscar-nominated song "Till It Happens to You" for the 2015 documentary The Hunting Ground, which sheds light on assault on college campuses, and performed it at the 2016 Oscars with fellow survivors onstage. In 2018, she <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a23609848/lady-gaga-christine-blasey-ford-kavanaugh-hearing/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="explained how trauma affects victims" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">explained how trauma affects victims</a> while supporting Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as she testified against then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Just because Gaga made Chromatica, a high-energy album of dance hits, as a way of coping with her pain, that doesn't mean she's entirely healed from the things that have hurt her. "And by the way, I'm not standing over here with a flag going, 'I'm all healed, everything's perfect.' It's not; it's a fight all the time," the singer told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.papermag.com/lady-gaga-chromatica-2645479910.html?rebelltitem=20#rebelltitem20" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Paper magazine" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Paper magazine</a> for a March interview.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I still work on myself constantly. I have bad days, I have good days," she added. "Yeah, I live in Chromatica, it took a minute to get here, but that doesn't mean I don't remember what happened. So if you're in pain and listening to this music, just know that I know what it's like to be in pain. And I know what it's like to also not let it ruin your life."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Read the full lyrics to "Free Woman" below.</p>(I'll remember that, I'll remember that)<br>(I'll remember that, that I)<br>(I'll remember that, I'll remember that)<br>(I'llrememberthat, that I) Iwalk the downtown, hear my sound<br>Noone knows me yet, not right now<br>But I am bound to set this feeling in motion<br>I walk the downtown, hear my sound I say that I want it, want it (Be free)<br>Don't fight it, fight it<br>But if I'm gonna go for it<br>I'll remember that, that<br>I say that I want it, want it (Be free)<br>Don't fight it, fight it<br>But if I'm gonna go for it<br>I'll remember that, that I I'm not nothing without a steady hand<br>I'm not nothing unless I know I can<br>I'm still something if I don't got a man<br>I'm a free woman, oh oh (Be free)<br>Oh yeah (Be free) This is my dance floor I fought for<br>A heart, that's what I'm livin' for<br>So light up my body and kiss me too hardly<br>We own the downtown, hear our sound I say that I want it, want it (Be free)<br>Don't fight it, fight it<br>But if I'm gonna go for it<br>I'll remember that, that<br>I say that I want it, want it (Be free)<br>Don't fight it, fight it<br>But if I'm gonna go for it<br>I'll remember that, that I I'm not nothing without a steady hand (I'm a free woman)<br>I'm not nothing unless I know I can (I'm a free woman)<br>I'm still something if I don't got a man<br>I'm a free woman, oh-oh (Be free, come on, woo) I'm a free woman<br>I'm a free woman (Be free)<br>I'm a free woman<br>I'm a free woman, oh oh (Be free)<br>Oh yeah (I'm a free woman) I'm not nothing without a steady hand (I'm a free woman)<br>I'm not nothing unless I know I can (I'm a free woman)<br>I'm still something if I don't got a man<br>I'm a free woman (Oh), oh oh (Be free)<span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
