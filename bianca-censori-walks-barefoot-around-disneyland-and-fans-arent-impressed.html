She wore a nude skin-tight dress, which some would compare to <a href=#>Kim Kardashian’s SKIMS</a>.</p><p>On top, Bianca wore a brown leather panel. Previously, she’d worn similar versions but without anything underneath, so like we said, this look was tame for her!</p><p>Although her outfit was ‘pretty standards’ in her terms, her ‘shoes’, were not. Ye’s wife walked around in ‘socks’ with her toes peeking out. Let’s hope that the concrete wasn’t too hot!</p><p>“She’s at Disneyland barefoot???????” questioned one shocked X, formerly known as <a href=#>Twitter</a>, user.</p><p>“No way Bianca at Disneyland barefoot. No f***** way,” wrote another.</p><p>Known for their ‘unique’ fashion sense, of course, this isn’t the first time the couple have been spotted barefoot.</p><p>One of the most memorable moments was last Summer when the two paraded around Italy with no shoes on.</p><p>The ‘barefoot’ trip came just a day before Adidas’ sale of leftover YEEZY sneakers after he was dropped from the brand for his anti-semitic remarks.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2aEcK7ImqWcmV2Ysq%2B%2FzqugZq%2BRobi0ecGaqZ6en6TBbq3RqKynnF2ZtrS6xLKjmqaUYq6vsIyfmKerXZa%2FprrTZqCmqKKawLSxw2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
