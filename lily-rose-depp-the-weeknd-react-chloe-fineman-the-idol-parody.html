Abel Tesfaye), who influences rising pop star Jocelyn, played by Lily-Rose Depp. The series has earned mixed reviews thus far, but what we do know for certain is that Saturday Night Live’s Chloe Fineman might just be our generation’s best impressionist, which she proved once again when she dropped a *chef's kiss* parody of Depp’s Jocelyn on Instagram last week."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

What do we know for sure? Though the show was originally announced in June 2021 and green-lit for a six-episode pilot season for November of that year, in April 2022 the release timeline was pushed due to “major changes.” A number of crew members walked away from the project, including <a href=# data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://deadline.com/2022/04/the-idol-director-amy-seimetz-exits-hbo-1235009540/ data-vars-ga-call-to-action="then-director Amy Seimetz" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">then-director Amy Seimetz</a>.
