It appeared to be a page of the Bible, and the verse? Well, it hit close to home.</p><p>"As soon as I got down on the ground, I noticed it was a Bible verse, and I was like holy crap," McCord remembers, <a href=#>according to USA Today</a>. "It was in a puddle of water. I said, 'I want to take care of this the best way I can,' so I gently scooped it up and carried it out the best I could."</p><p>The passage is from the first chapter of Joel — the King James Version — and reads: "O Lord, to thee will I cry: For the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.”</p><p>McCord posted a photo of the paper <a href=#>on Facebook,</a>&nbsp;where it was shared more than 50,000 times.</p><p>"We were like this is unreal, this is unbelievable," McCord recalls, speaking of&nbsp;his coworker, Misty Carver. "When we had both fully read it, we looked at each other — and I will never forget this moment — we both burst into tears. I was ghost white, and we just prayed. There was nothing else to do. Still to this moment, almost four hours after the fact, I don't have words for it.”</p><p>The poignant verse is&nbsp;a perfect reflection of the tragedy that swept the Smoky Mountains on&nbsp;Nov. 27 and 28, charring 500 acres, leaving three people dead and destroying more than 150 structures. Dollywood itself remains largely intact.<a href=#> Dolly Parton</a>, who not only owns the theme park but grew up in the area, reacted to&nbsp;the tragic events, noting her thankfulness that many of Gatlinburg's defining businesses were spared.</p><p>“I have been watching the terrible fires in the Great Smoky Mountains and I am heartbroken,” she says.&nbsp;“I am praying for all the families affected by the fire and the firefighters who are working so hard to keep everyone safe. It is a blessing that my Dollywood theme park, the DreamMore Resort and so many businesses in Pigeon Forge have been spared."</p><p><strong>Country Artists Who Have Suffered Unthinkable Tragedies</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnaecoca4u86dZJ6loKG8urHEZpmimpyaerex0aycZq%2BZobGntdGeZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
