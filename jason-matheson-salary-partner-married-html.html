One cannot fathom how nerve-wracking it is to satisfy the audiences sitting on their couch at home and picking every detail you make. The job needs instant&nbsp;correction, making skills, and a calm personality in case something goes south. Take all these skills, and Jason Mathson is the name that concludes.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>The two-times winner of Emmy Awards, Jason, is someone, who has cemented his name on the Television domain.

Boyfriend?&nbsp;</h2><p>Being gay isn't something people choose, but they do face choices about whether and how to handle it. In the case of Jason Matheson, he&nbsp;is openly gay and he never shies to expresse his sexuality. A supporter of the LGBT community, he has even admitted on one of the tweets that he is confident enough to not be offended every time comedians make a gay joke.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Talking about his dating affairs, Jason indeed has found the love of his life. He met his partner via Match.com, an online dating portal and the man is none other than Collin Haas. Their romance timeline is unknown at the moment, but fans would love to know the prequels of their relationships. The gay couple exchanged their vows on the 13th of September, 2014. The married pair had dropped a selfie on the same day via&nbsp;Jason’s twitter.

In an interview in June 2018, Jason recalled his bitter memories with his father. He stated that his father was always disappointed with him. Jason came to realize later in his life that his father was gay, and his frustration towards his son always had been the reflection of his jealousy of not being able to open up about his sexuality. He was supposedly unsatisfied with his son, who was openly gay and lucky enough to be born in modern society.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Jason’s dad sadly passed away in 2003, at the age of 49.
