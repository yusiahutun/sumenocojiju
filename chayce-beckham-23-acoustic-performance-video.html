One year after winning Season 19, Beckham is signed to Wheelhouse Records, with a new EP available on digital streaming providers and a catalog of proven hits and covers to support it when he takes stages this summer.
During a recent visit to the Taste of Country Nights studio, he played two songs: &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Enjoy his fine finger-picking as he opens up about his life before reality television.</p><p>"23" is not on his Doin It Right EP, a six-song collection that features "Tell Me Twice" (a song inspired by his mother) and a sultry Tom Douglas co-write called "Talk&nbsp;to Me" that presents the Californian in new ways. Beckham is a soft-spoken singer and songwriter, but soft-spoken certainly doesn't mean boring in this case. During his conversation with&nbsp;<a href=#>Taste of Country&nbsp;Nights</a>' Evan Paul, he spoke about the <a href=#>moving songs from his past</a> and present and <a href=#>gave advice</a> to current American Idol finalists. He also&nbsp;compared his own performance on the show to those who've come before him.</p><p>"I'm very hard on myself, but I hands-down think I may be the worst singer that has won American Idol," Beckham insists. "If you're going off of singing — if you're going off of who has the most vocal capability and technique. If that's what you're gauging it off of, they'd all beat me. I take pride in songs and songwriting and connecting with people like that, but when you get in there with those tigers ... those people can sing."</p><p>Professionals can decide if that's true or not, but plenty of great stylists have had long careers in country music. Legendary songwriter John Prine is certainly one of them. He influenced Beckham, and he'll prove it soon,&nbsp;if&nbsp;this acoustic performance video of&nbsp;"23"&nbsp;can top 200 likes. It's a rare cover that you need to hear to fully understand who Beckham is today.</p><p>Watch the above video and <a href=#>subscribe to Taste of Country's YouTube channel</a> for more acoustic performances.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter" readability=2><p><span class=visually-hidden>attachment-doin it right ep</span></p>Wheelhouse Records<p>loading...</p></figure><h2 class=photogallery-title>Country 'American Idol' Stars Who Disappeared</h2><p>We cheered for them.
