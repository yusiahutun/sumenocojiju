They can make everything from a strapless dress to jeans and a tee office worthy while celebrities like Hailey Bieber and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Dua Lipa</a> have made the case for wearing blazers while running errands or hitting the town for a night out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Considering how versatile they are, you need a few blazers in your closet. Yet we are going to be honest â€” finding a blazer that fits properly can take some searching, so we did the hard work for you. We asked celebrity stylists how to style blazers and researched the best ones available based on stylish designs, quality fabrics, and an extensive range of sizes. So, whether you are adding to your blazer collection or building it from scratch, we found the best blazers for your next power play.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-jcrew-parke-blazer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>J.Crew Parke Blazer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="J.Crew Parke Blazer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/AsKcaUJOk_5L9VNSUezUN2_vqXY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/J.Crew-Parke-Blazer-19b7032c0f1446e699d8cea779ff16d2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>J.Crew</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a versatile blazer that suits a range of body types, budgets, and occasions, we pick J.Crew's Parke Blazer. In fact, the brand dubs it the goldilocks of blazers because it's not too tight or loose, not too long or short. The sleek design features moderate lapels, flat pockets at the front for a sleek look while a hidden inner pocket can store any small items. Reviewers like how the blazer is lined and that the sustainable wool and elastane blend feels high quality and doesn't wrinkle throughout the day. With sizes available in petite and tall, this design truly is a crowd pleaser. Though the black and heather coal shades are staples in anyone's closet, we do wish the blazer came in more punchy colors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> 00-24, petite and tall available |<strong> Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Materials: </strong>Wool, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-suiting-theory-etiennette-blazer-in-good-wool></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Suiting</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Theory Etiennette Blazer in Good Wool</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Theory Etiennette Blazer in Good Wool" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/J5bz1R5RdhTzBkhcl5r7umlzvH0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Theory-Etiennette-Blazer-in-Good-Wool-80acc0dc1bd2409d887ce79bd586c10c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Theory</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>It's pricey.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This suit means business. Designed by the workwear expert, the sleek design makes you look and feel your best. The mid-sized lapels balance your chest, while the cutaway front nips your waist and plays up your hips. Even better, the blazer is made consciously from fully traceable wool and eco-conscious mills in Italy.

You get everything you want in a blazer at an affordable price. A classic lapel, slight shoulder pads to add structure, and deep pockets. The stretchy material is machine washable for extra convenience, just skip the dryer. And with 18 colors to choose from, you can stock up on a few different shades to keep on rotation. Like with a lot of Amazon purchases though, this blazer often comes squished in a poly bag, so be prepared to steam it before wearing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XS-XXL |<strong> Colors:</strong> 18 | <strong>Materials: </strong>Polyester, rayon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-fitted-mango-fitted-suit-blazer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Fitted</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mango Fitted Suit Blazer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mango Fitted Suit Blazer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/jsl6oBDzls_dfAF566L7rBp21E4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Mango-Fitted-Suit-Blazer-2c82a1737b764ee68331a9db7e997a56.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Mango</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>It's dry clean only.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">From Taylor Swift to Kaia Gerber, celebrities have been rocking Mango blazers, which look way more expensive than they actually are. While the brand makes blazers in all the latest cuts and colors, you can't go wrong with this classic fitted suit blazer. The single button and notched lapel is simple and universally flattering, going with a variety of outfits from slacks to skirts. As you may expect, this blazer is dry clean only, so it will take more energy to fit into your laundry schedule.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> 1-22 |<strong> Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Materials: </strong>Polyester, viscose, elastane<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-pinstripe-favorite-daughter-the-break-up-blazer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Pinstripe</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Favorite Daughter The Break-Up Blazer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Favorite Daughter The Break-Up Blazer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/vf3NMjYbawSyaZ5GJ0bz9ykj9Ko=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Favorite-Daughter-The-Break-Up-Blazer-2fc4a42b2f7d417c8f02e7ad9c0b7b56.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The navy pinstripe and longline silhouette of this blazer will elongate your figure while the shoulder pads balance out your hips. It's the perfect length to toss on top of a mini like Kourtney Kardashian or just wear over some tailored jeans. Some things are worth borrowing from the boys. Due to the longline length, this blazer may overwhelm shorter frames, so we wish it came in a petite version.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XXS-XL |<strong> Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Materials:</strong> Cotton, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-anine-bing-diana-blazer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Anine Bing Blazer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Anine Bing Diana Blazer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7jXW1b-93L18o9jesKr51Ly_tmE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/anine-bing-diana-blazer-2b74c9229ebc4d93848213841f0db835.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Anine Bing</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Donâ€™t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If youâ€™re going to splurge on a piece, pick a classic one that can be worn year after year â€” that means everything from the design, cut, color, and material need to stand the test of time. This piece is made from a textured Italian wool blend, making it thicker and warmer than your usual blazer. Even though you may only be able to wear it in colder weather, the herringbone pattern also never fails to look sophisticated and will stay in style for years to come.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>XXS-XL&nbsp; |<strong> Colors:</strong> 1&nbsp; | <strong>Materials:</strong> Acrylic, wool, polyester</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-oversized-everlane-the-80s-blazer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Oversized</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane â€™80s Blazer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Everlane The &amp;rsquo;80s Blazer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YaNN2MVdjWYyBlzrhNbRdhZP0Qk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/everlane-the-way-high-drape-pant-and-the-80s-blazer-4953c688fc494c109f758ed042b144d0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Everlane</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you are a fan of the oversized blazer trend, check out this design from Everlane. Spotted on Katie Holmes, this '80s inspired blazer makes a statement with its oversized, relaxed silhouette and shoulder pads. One of our writers instantly snapped it up when she saw it on Holmes and says it's the closest she's ever felt to channeling her '80s style icon Julia Roberts. "It's light and slouched but structured and well-tailored," writes <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Tamim Alnuweiri</a>. "The fit remains oversized on me, even though that is often overlooked with clothing in my size." We love that the blazer goes up to size 20, and those who are petite will likely have to size down. You can pair it with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">matching wool pants</a> or wear it over bootcut jeans like Kendall Jenner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> 00-20 |<strong> Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Materials: </strong>Shell: Lyocell, cotton.

"If you are looking to accentuate your waist, look for a collarless style blazer that hits at the waist," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Stitch Fix</a> stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Stephanie Valponi</a>. This blazer does just that and comes in bold colors like green and pink as well as basic navy and blue. Made from Camden Stretch fabric, the blazer moves with you while still maintaining its shape for a polished look. Though the blazer is fairly affordable, it is dry clean only, so factor that into the cost.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> 14-28 |<strong> Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Materials: </strong>Rayon, nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-wrinkle-resistant-athleta-avenue-blazer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Wrinkle-Resistant</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Athleta Avenue Blazer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Athleta Avenue Blazer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/D-aJ_NyB8u3WQ8fBxvPv0FOX63g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Athleta-Avenue-Blazer-1070bf8fd8d844049ab23ea0128ab3f9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Athleta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you travel frequently and want a blazer you can pop into a suitcase without worrying about how it will look later, you've found your match. Made from nylon and lycra, this style is wrinkle and abrasion-resistant, so you don't have to worry about snags either. It's also machine washable, cutting out one part of your dry cleaning bill. Other practical details, like a UPF rating of 50 and an inner pocket, make it great for travel and commuting. The only thing that could make this blazer better is more colors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> 0-26 |<strong> Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Materials:</strong> Nylon, lyrca</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-double-breasted-good-american-scuba-blazer-20></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Double Breasted</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Good American Scuba Blazer 2.0</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Good American Scuba Blazer 2.0" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/E3TPXnUFG6K0_SUmcQH3UPu6Ym0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/good-american-scuba-blazer-20-4bfdb10612234ba7bfe60edff67e776c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Good American</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a more suited and tailored look, the double breasted blazer creates a fitted appeal that can be worn from the office to the cocktail hour. This piece is modern, yet timeless, with a strong lapel collar, slit pockets, and buttoned sleeves. It's also constructed with stretch fabric, which keeps it comfortable and safe from wrinkling. You can look and feel your best, as the smart suit glides with your movements and keeps you looking sharp. When it's time to get it freshened up, you will have to bring it to the dry-cleaners, however, as you cannot hand wash it yourself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XS-5XL |<strong> Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Materials:</strong> Polyester, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cropped-laws-of-motion-asset-blazer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cropped</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Laws of Motion Blazer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Laws of Motion Asset Blazer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7x10BD7Ad7AHBGOHfM4ZOGxo3hc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Laws-of-Motion-Asset-Blazer-1bf817a184b048d3af927a3ba7c27066.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Laws of Motion</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Donâ€™t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After seeing this piece in person,&nbsp;InStyle writer Bianca Kratky says she was pleasantly surprised with the stitching and feel of the fabric. The brand scans your body (from the safety of your home) after asking you a series of questions to custom-make the pieces just for you. Naturally, that means it takes a bit longer to deliver, but we think the custom fit and sustainable practice is very well worth it. Thanks to elongated sleeves, the cropped hem looks balanced out, especially when paired with high-waisted pants.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>Unlimited, customized to you |<strong> Colors:</strong>&nbsp; 5 | <strong>Materials:</strong> Wool, polyester, acrylic</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-schoolboy-polo-ralph-lauren-double-knit-jacquard-blazer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Schoolboy</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Polo Ralph Lauren Double-Knit Jacquard Blazer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Polo Ralph Lauren Double-Knit Jacquard Blazer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Fksn3PGGP_YLC881A3D7NQyPAp4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Polo-Ralph-Lauren-Double-Knit-Jacquard-Blazer-3ad582d0ed3640b09ae0a1dd939097b0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ralph Lauren</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">I used to have a college professor who wore this blazer to every lecture â€” I remember the brand's monogram â€” and now I see why. The classic design looks sharp and pulls any outfit together instantly. With its slim fit, this single button, cotton blend will skim your curves and not add any bulk. The gold buttons and monogram add just the right accent to the otherwise no frills designs. Consider it a one and done jacket.

Look no further than the It-Girl-favorite leather blazer. Swap it in for your regular leather jacket, and you'll look extra stylish with the intriguing combination of a sophisticated cut combined with a fierce fabric. We like BlankNYC's faux version that comes in your standard black as well as a rich green and brown and features an oversized fit with large pockets and a single button for effortless ease. Wear it with trousers or jeans during the day and then transition into the evening by taking a cue from celebrities like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Gigi Hadid</a> by keeping only a bra on below.

The soft lavender shade invites a sense of whimsy into your outfit, while the linen will keep you well-ventilated and cool.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we adore linen, it does have the tendency to wrinkle.

Rather than a button closure, the silky blazer can be tied closed using the provided belt, which also helps to accentuate your figure some more. You'll still find the classic blazer details, like lapel collars and buttoned sleeves, but in a much more relaxed fabric (and vibrant color). As a matter of fact, we love the lively hue so much that we wish it was offered in more colors since we know yellow isn't exactly the most universal color to wear. We recommend pairing the bold blazer with a mock neck for the day and then a bralette at night.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XXS-XL |<strong> Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Materials: </strong>Polyester, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-colorful-makemechic-collar-sleeve-blazer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Colorful</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>MakeMeChic Collar Sleeve Blazer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="MakeMeChic Collar Sleeve Blazer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/AJbElExBZMIur7dc63vO2Z5lyiE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/makemechic-collar-sleeve-blazer-70a93e1ce4f94c838a6211169df1a8da.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Still obsessed with the Barbie movie?

A pop of color on a well-tailored suit is always a good option to own, and this one comes in eight additional shades. Wear this with a white bodysuit and your favorite blue jeans to a brunch date for a powerful yet playful outfit.

It shouldn't feel too tight when you move your arms. She says the bend in the waist should also land where you naturally curve, providing movement while also looking customly tailored. You want to make sure the sleeves aren't too short or long â€” they should land right at your wrist. If they are a bit too long, you can cuff them for an instant fix or get them tailored.
