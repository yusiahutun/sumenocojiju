When questioned regarding his riding in the early part of the Home Straight and as to whether there was an opportunity to improve between two runners sooner than he did, rider stated that after following the 4th placegetter and having a runner positioned to his outside, he commenced to shift out with a view to obtaining clear running to the outside of the 4th placegetter. He said when the forementioned runner did not continue to give ground as he had expected, he was then held up for clear running between the 400M and the 300M before shifting to the inside of the 4th placegetter to secure clear running. He added that when the 3rd and 4th placegetters shifted ground slightly, his mount raced tight between those two runners between the 300M and the 200M. Rider further stated that his decision to shift out initially was influenced by the fact that he felt the 3rd placegetter would shift out, resulting in the run which was already tight closing and he was of the opinion his best option at that stage was to endeavour to improve to the outside - Race 599.</p><p><b>TRADITION (J111) </b>jumped only fairly.

From a wide barrier was shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
