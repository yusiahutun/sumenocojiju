It needs to feel <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>firm enough</a> to hold your new chest in place, but not too compressive. Without question, the zipper should be in the front because you won’t be able to put your arms above your head (I don’t even want to talk about how hard it was to wash my hair) or stretch to reach around your back for literally months. It can’t be overly supportive because then your body won’t learn how to carry the new weight.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">My only requirement was that it be <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>comfortable and soft</a>. As read the bulleted list of “do nots” from my plastic surgeon, I thought, where the heck am I going to find a bra like this? But as my luck would have it, there are plenty of on-sale options at Amazon right now for October Prime Day, aka <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Prime Big Deal Days</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although none of my friends are considering a boob job at the moment, I’m still telling everyone to grab these bras while they’re on sale with discounts as high as 45 percent.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shop-the-7-best-on-sale-bras-for-breast-implants></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Shop the 7 Best On-Sale Bras for Breast Implants:</span></h2><span class=heading-toc id=toc-brooks-zip-20-sports-bra></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Brooks Zip 2.0 Sports Bra&nbsp;</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not to be dramatic, but I don’t even want to think about how my recovery would have been without this bra. After I told my plastic surgeon that no such bra exists that checks all his post-op bra criteria, he told me this one tends to be popular among patients. I had no idea what to expect, so I panic-ordered this bra in four different sizes the week before my surgery. I was shocked by just how soft the material was — it honestly was as smooth and soft as bed sheets, and the cups were molded and fit like a very delicate hug.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Three days after surgery, I could switch out of my surgical bra for this one and it felt so gentle and comforting, which was very important to me because I was concerned about popping or squeezing or somehow breaking myself (I knew the stats on this imaginary problem were very low, but still). The bottom band wrapped somewhat snugly around my torso, yet it never applied pressure. But this anxiety was actually grounded in reality — it was imperative to wear a soft, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>extremely un-constrictive bra</a> for the first two months post-op because all bra bands would likely land right around where the incisions were made underneath my breast. I was expecting at least a little bit of painful friction for the first few days, but it never happened then or ever.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shefit-ultimate-sports-bra></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>SheFit Ultimate Sports Bra</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I know what you’re thinking here and I don’t blame you, but looks aren’t everything when you’re recovering from surgery. When I got this bra in the mail before surgery, it scared me. The straps looked intense and because they’re adjustable, I didn’t know if I was making them too tight and applying too much pressure. At my final pre-op appointment I asked my surgeon and he gave me a simple, obvious answer: Fasten the strap when you feel comfortable and supported. So, that’s what I did, and ironically, the adjustable straps became my favorite feature.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This bra provides more support than the Brooks, but it was absolutely perfect on days I woke up feeling a little achey and sore. I’d wrap myself in this massive bra and before I knew it, the discomfort was gone.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cosabella-soire-confidence-molded-bra></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cosabella Soire Confidence Molded Bra&nbsp;</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pre-boob job, I rarely thought about bras. Most of the time, I just <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>opted for pasties</a> and didn’t wear one at all except to work out. Now, it delights me to say that I can no longer go loosey-goosey — I need the support. The <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Soire Confidence Molded Bra</a> from Cosabella gives you exactly that. Once you slip it on, it’s easy to forget it’s there. I’ve even slept in it without a worry or irritation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As the name suggests, the cups mold to your boobs and the underwire is a lot sturdier than you’d think. You’re not swimming in fabric — rather, the see-through mesh is equal parts stretchy, supportive, and comfortable, not to mention airy (a massive relief after spending the last few weeks sweating in the above sports bras). And the real kicker? It’s sexy, but in a chill way. I love it so much that it’s pretty much all I wear and I’ve never seen the price slashed quite like this before — at 45 percent off, it’s going to be hard not to buy the entire collection.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even if you’re not planning on breast implants any time soon, you’ll want to snag these comfy, on-sale bras before the Prime Day sales end tonight.
