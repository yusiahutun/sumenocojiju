Six years ago, I gave away a Tory Burch bag to a friend. It was a leopard-print bag with the brand's gold TB emblem front and center. I bought it when I went off to college, the same one Burch attended, because I felt so different from the preppy Ivy Leaguers around me—I thought it might help me fit in."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It was a leopard-print bag with the brand's gold TB emblem front and center. I bought it when I went off to college, the same one Burch attended, because I felt so different from the preppy Ivy Leaguers around me—I thought it might help me fit in. Ultimately, I was no Blair Waldorf, and the bag never felt like me. At the time, Tory Burch seemed like a buttoned-up brand that was far too polite for my personal style.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But the Tory Burch of the past looks very different than the Tory Burch of the now. I've squealed with delight at every single runway show the brand has put on in the past two years, and at the fall 2023 show, the thing that made me fangirl the hardest was a bag.</p><img alt="new york, new york february 13 a model walks the runway during the tory burch aw 2023 new york fashion week show at 51 chambers street on february 13, 2023 in new york city photo by taylor hillwireimage" title="Tory Burch - February 2023 New York Fashion Week" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1676413629.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Taylor Hill</span></p><img alt="tory burch fw23new york fashion week02132023" title="tory burch fw23new york fashion week02132023" width=2554 height=3830 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tb-fw23-show-details-dl-056-1676413616.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Dan &amp;amp; Corina Lecca</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It looked nothing like the proper one I toted around to beer-soaked frat parties all those years ago—this one was actually a little weird. The brand's famous emblem was cut in two pieces, the bottom half swinging out from under it like the pendulum of an old clock. The models held the handle with loose fingertips, and the top flap was left opened, like they got ready in a rush.</p><img alt="tory burch fw23new york fashion week02132023" title="tory burch fw23new york fashion week02132023" width=1080 height=1920 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tb-fw23-show-9x16-look34-jpg-1676408618.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Dan &amp;amp; Corina Lecca</span></p><img alt="tory burch fw23new york fashion week02132023" title="tory burch fw23new york fashion week02132023" width=2554 height=3830 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tb-fw23-show-details-dl-256-1676408629.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Dan &amp;amp; Corina Lecca</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the show notes, Burch wrote that she wanted to break down the traditional wardrobe and rebuild it was an "undone attitude." The collection was all about "the confidence that comes with being unapologetically yourself," she said. The new Tory girl breaks rules instead of following them. Other logo-less bags on the runway had a similarly undone attitude, with chains tied to the base of the handle like an accessory added on from the model's own jewelry box.</p><img alt="tory burch fw23new york fashion week02132023" title="tory burch fw23new york fashion week02132023" width=1080 height=1920 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tb-fw23-show-9x16-look15-jpg-1676408758.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Dan &amp;amp; Corina Lecca</span></p><img alt="tory burch fw23new york fashion week02132023" title="tory burch fw23new york fashion week02132023" width=2554 height=3830 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tb-fw23-show-details-dl-111-1676408769.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Dan &amp;amp; Corina Lecca</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Recently, fashion fans online have been talking about the power of a worn-in bag, inspired by two of the greatest to ever do it: Mary-Kate Olsen with her red-wine-stained pastel Balenciaga city bag and Jane Birkin with her beat-up Birkin adorned with stickers and trinkets. Burch's new hit-bag-in-the-making takes the principle of not caring what happens to your purse and makes it something you can buy instead of earn. Of course, the only thing that would make this bag more impossibly cool was if it was stained with wine or had a lace-monogrammed handkerchief tied to the side. There's nothing sexier than a bag that tells the story of the cool woman carrying it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Finally, there's a Tory Burch bag that represents who I am instead of who I feel the need to become. And once I get my hands on this one, I definitely won't be giving it away.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
