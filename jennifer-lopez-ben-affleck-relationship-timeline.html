Not helped by its strange title (pronounced JEE-lee), the movie flopped, but sparks flew between the leading stars.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At the time, J.Lo was <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a46674411/jennifer-lopez-complete-relationship-history/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="still married" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">still married</a> to her second husband, dancer Cris Judd; she and Affleck went public with their relationship soon after her divorce from Judd. (The divorce was finalized in 2003.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2016, the actor and singer reflected on the beginning of her relationship with Affleck in an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/celebrity/jennifer-lopez-says-there-was-genuine-love-with-ben-affleck/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">People</a>. “We didn’t try to have a public relationship,” she said. “We just happened to be together at the birth of the tabloids, and it was like ‘Oh my God.’ It was just a lot of pressure.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also revealed her first impression of Affleck. “I felt like…‘Okay, this is it,’” she said. “[But] sometimes I feel like what you think people are and how you see them when you love them is different than when they reveal later.”</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">2002: Ben makes a cameo in “Jenny From the Block.”</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The now-iconic music video features a steamy moment from Bennifer. With J.Lo in a hot-pink bikini and Affleck in a white tank, the lovebirds sunbathe on a boat while the Good Will Hunting writer and star lovingly engages in some PDA with J.Lo’s bottom (a part of her body the media obsessed over back then). The video also made tongue-in-cheek reference to the tabloids’ obsession with the relationship, including surveillance camera footage and pap photos of the two.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2010, J.Lo talked about the pressures the media put on their relationship during a guest appearance on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFAE_B_I_vs" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Graham Norton Show" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Graham Norton Show</a>. “I love Ben, he’s a great guy, but it was a lot for both of us to be under that type of siege for two years straight,” she said. “We were on the cover of every magazine, every week, it was just a weird thing. … Our relationship, I think, did suffer because of that. That’s not the only reason…but I think it definitely played a part in the dynamic of our relationship.”</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">November 2002: They get engaged.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">J.Lo confirmed the happy news in an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSNKk1B-AwY" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Diane Sawyer" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Diane Sawyer</a>. “It’s the most magnificent thing I've ever seen,” she said of the 6.1-carat pink diamond from Harry Winston that Affleck gave her.

Also starring Liv Tyler, the film ultimately underperformed at the box office, grossing only $36 million.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">September 2003: They postpone their wedding.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Days before the two were set to officially tie the knot, they released a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/media-in-frenzy-over-postponed-bennifer-wedding-20030913-gdwc0c.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="joint statement" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">joint statement</a> announcing the ceremony’s postponement:</p>Due to the excessive media attention surrounding our wedding, we have decided to postpone the date. When we found ourselves seriously contemplating hiring three separate “decoy brides” at three different locations, we realized that something was awry. We began to feel that the spirit of what should have been the happiest day of our lives could be compromised. We felt what should have been a joyful and sacred day could be spoiled for us, our families and our friends.<h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">January 2004: Bennifer is over.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On January 22, 2004, the two ended their engagement. J.Lo confirmed the sad news through her spokesperson.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I am confirming the report that Jennifer Lopez has ended her engagement to Ben Affleck,” the statement said at the time, per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.mtv.com/news/1484539/j-lo-and-ben-call-off-engagement/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=MTV class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">MTV</a>. “At this difficult time, we ask that you respect her privacy.”</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">June 2004: J.Lo moves on.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In June of 2004, the “Let’s Get Loud” singer married singer-songwriter and longtime friend Marc Anthony. The two welcomed twins, daughter Emme Muñiz and son Max Muñiz, in 2008. They separated in 2014.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In her 2014 book, True Love, J.Lo reflected on the turbulent period between announcing her split from Affleck and marrying Anthony. “Ben and I split up at the moment when I thought we were committing to each other forever, it was my first real heartbreak, it felt like my heart had been torn out of my chest,” she wrote, per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://pagesix.com/2014/11/06/j-lo-dating-marc-anthony-was-how-i-dealt-with-ben-affleck-split/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Page Six" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Page Six</a>. “I sought out comfort in another person, tried to find someone who could make me feel loved and wanted in my loneliest hour. … Marc came back into my life three days after I should have been at the altar saying ‘I do’ to another man.”</p><img alt="exclusive, premium rates apply new york february 14 exclusive marc anthony, jennifer lopez and their kids max and emme on stage before he performs valentines day show at madison square garden on february 14, 2009 in new york city photo by kevin mazurwireimage" title="Marc Anthony Performs Valentine&amp;apos;s Day Show At Madison Square Garden" width=3000 height=2991 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-84800721-1620751277.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Kevin Mazur</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Marc Anthony, Jennifer Lopez, and their kids, Max and Emme, onstage at Madison Square Garden on February 14, 2009</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She added that their romance may have been her attempt at a quick fix for her heartbreak. “Thinking back, maybe deep down I knew that this was a Band-Aid on the cut, that my wound hadn’t been stitched or healed,” she wrote. “But I pushed all that to the back of my mind. Because life takes unpredictable twists and turns, right? And you’ve just got to go with what you feel is best in the moment.”</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">2005: Ben marries Jennifer Garner.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Affleck, too, soon moved on.

Start stepping into that, start owning a little bit of who you are,’” she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=124 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She added that her rekindled romance with Affleck was what inspired her to get back in the studio. “When Ben and I got back together, it was just like, ‘I want to make music again, I want to get back in the studio,’” she <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.etonline.com/jennifer-lopez-details-how-ben-affleck-inspired-her-return-to-music-exclusive-219534 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">said</a>. “I was very, very inspired.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=125 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She continued, “It ended this 20-year journey about a lot of questions that I had about love and being myself, a hopeless romantic, and what it means to really enter into a kind of healthier, more self-accepting phase for myself.

You think you’re doing okay, so you shrug it off,” Lopez says. “I had a broken heart once I lost the love of my life, my best friend, and I couldn’t talk for so many years, and that was the hardest part.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=129 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Elsewhere in the doc, Lopez tells Affleck, “I think I was angry at you for a long time.

I think I need to forgive myself [for] some things.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=130 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When they eventually reunited in 2021, Affleck says, he initially asked that their relationship not appear on Lopez’s social media at all.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=131 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Getting back together, I said, ‘Listen, one of the things I don’t want is a relationship on social media,’” he says. “Then I sort of realized it’s not a fair thing to ask. It’s sort of like, you’re gonna marry a boat captain and you go, ‘Well, I don’t like the water.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=134 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lopez adds, “I don’t think [Ben] is very comfortable with me doing all of this. But he loves me, he knows I’m an artist, and he’s gonna support me in every way he can, because he knows you can’t stop me from making the music I made…he doesn’t want to stop me. But that doesn’t mean he's comfortable being the muse.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6GutbHSrWaaa2Zohnd%2Fk21mo52eo7ansdFmo6iola96o7HNZpifnpyasKx50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZK2hnZq5qrrEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
