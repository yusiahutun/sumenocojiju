It wouldn't be a Swift album without a couple of breakup ballads, after all. "There'll be happiness after you / But there was happiness because of you / Both of these things can be true / There is happiness," Swift croons in the chorus of "Happiness."</p><p>Evermore's seventh song, "Happiness," is about overcoming a breakup by learning to be happy for someone else. It is unlikely that "Happiness" is about any of Swift's exes, though. Instead, critics theorized that <a href=#>The Great Gatsby</a> probably inspired it. "Seemingly named for Daisy's first words in the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel ('I'm p-paralyzed with happiness'), the soothing ballad finds Swift stepping into the character's lovelorn shoes," Patrick Ryan wrote in <a href=#>USA Today</a>, hours after the album dropped.</p><p>Swift even paraphrases one of Daisy's most famous lines: "I hope she'll be a fool — that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool." Swift, in turn, sings, "I hope she'll be your beautiful fool. Who takes my spot next to you." Perhaps the most overt Gatsby reference, Swift describes a "green light" and a failed romance. "All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness."</p><p>So there you have it, this one isn't about Joe Jonas. It's (probably)&nbsp;about Jay Gatsby.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma3FkZoB4e9OhnGaqlZa5brnEmqWippdir6a0yKebZqyRrrmwvoysrqKepKh6qa3PqaCnnaOoeq3F0aKarGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
