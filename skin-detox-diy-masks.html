OK, it’ll be pretty great for your skin, too.</p><p>Now’s not the time for any of us to indulge in some much-needed retail therapy (i.e. blowing our holiday cash load at Sephora), which is why you should get to mixing up these easy masks right in your kitchen. There’s a very good chance that all this stuff is already in your cabinets—and if it isn’t, well, send your boyfriend/husband/brother/cousin/favorite uncle to the store to pick it up. You’re not going anywhere.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/teeth-white.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/n95-face-masks.jpg><p><strong>Coffee Mud Mask</strong><br>Use a wooden spoon to mix two tablespoons of a cosmetic grade clay, like kaolin or bentonite (you know, that old jar of <a href=# rel=nofollow>Aztec Secret</a>), and a teaspoon of dry coffee grounds. Add up to a teaspoon and a half of apple cider vinegar, depending on how sensitive your skin is—if it’s super reactive, stick with less—and mix until the ingredients combine into a paste. Spread the concoction all over your face using your fingers and let dry, then rinse with warm water. You’ll get the deep-cleansing, toxin-absorbing properties of the clay, the anti-inflammatory and exfoliating properties of the coffee grounds, and the pH-balancing effects of the apple cider vinegar.</p><p><strong>Coconut Clay Mask</strong><br>For a more hydrating detox treatment that will both draw out impurities from the skin and soothe any breakouts or irritation, blend two tablespoons of bentonite clay with one teaspoon of virgin <a href=# id=auto-tag_coconut-oil data-tag=coconut-oil>coconut oil</a> and half a tablespoon of raw honey—honey is perfect for nourishing and repairing stressed, dehydrated skin. Apply the mixture to clean, dry skin, leave for 15 minutes, and rinse with warm water. You can also use a warm, damp washcloth to remove the mask if you could use some gentle exfoliation.</p><p><strong>Minty Chocolate Mask</strong><br>Mix a half tablespoon of bentonite clay, a half tablespoon of cocoa, 2 tablespoons of plain yogurt, and a few drops of peppermint essential oil in a bowl. Use your fingers to spread a thin layer over clean, dry skin and leave it on for up to 20 minutes before wiping away with a warm, damp washcloth. The antioxidant flavonoids in cocoa are great for detoxification, while peppermint improves blood flow to speed up cell turnover and bring some much-needed color back into your face.</p><p><strong>Avocado Lemon Mask</strong><br>Don’t know what to do with the other half of that avocado? Mash it into a bowl until it’s smooth, then add the juice of half of a lemon and a tablespoon of coconut oil. The healthy fats and lipids in the avocado will soften dry skin and leave it feeling super smooth, and the lemon will help to shed dead skin cells. Apply a thin layer of the mask all over your face and leave on for up to 20 minutes, then rinse away with warm water.</p><p><strong>Deep Cleansing Charcoal Mask</strong><br>You may very well need to bring in the big guns post-stuffing binge … so go dig up that activated charcoal you bought after <strong>Shailene Woodley</strong> copped to using it for everything from whiter teeth to digestive health. Combine a quarter teaspoon of the charcoal with a teaspoon of bentonite clay, a tablespoon of witch hazel, and half a teaspoon of raw honey—start by mixing the honey and witch hazel first, then add the clay and charcoal. You can add some essential oils too if you like; tea tree and lavender work particularly well for deep cleansing. Spread it all over your face and let dry for up to twenty minutes, then rinse well.</p><p><strong>MORE: <a href=#>Does Your Skin Actually Need a Makeup Detox?</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1mmpqqlWSCcXyQcWhoq5ueu26wxK2msWWUnsZuucCsoqxn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
