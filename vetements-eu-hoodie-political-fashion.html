The CFDA handed out pink pins in support of Planned Parenthood. More than 40 designers signed on to support the cause, which aimed to&nbsp;raise awareness and money for the critical healthcare that the organisation's centres provide. Two months later, Trump&nbsp;signed a bill which was aimed at cutting off federal funding to&nbsp;Planned Parenthood.</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">9</span><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">The #TiedTogether catwalk campaign</h2><img alt="Fashion show, Fashion model, Fashion, Runway, Clothing, Dress, Shoulder, Model, Haute couture, Beauty, " data-cy=slide-image-9 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/17/33/white-bandana-nyfw.jpg title="Fashion show, Fashion model, Fashion, Runway, Clothing, Dress, Shoulder, Model, Haute couture, Beauty, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Getty</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In addition to supporting Planned Parenthood, New York Fashion Week attendees were encouraged to stand up against Trump's travel ban with the #TiedTogether campaign.
