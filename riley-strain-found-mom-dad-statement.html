&#34;The grace that you've given us, it means a lot,&#34; Chris Whiteid remarked during a 7-minute press event on Friday night (March 22).
Michelle's comments — while short — were particularly emotional."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

His last stop was at Luke's 32 Bridge, named after&nbsp;<a href=#>Luke Bryan</a>.</li></ul><p>"I just ask that you&nbsp;mamas out there hug your babies tight tonight, please," she said as tears started. "Please for me, hug your babies tight tonight. And again thank you. Thank you for sharing our story."</p><p>This was not the outcome they hoped for, but they expressed some relief that it's over.</p><p>"And those of you that helped us keep Riley’s face in front of the cameras, you’ve helped us get some closure here and let us take our boy home," Gilbert said.</p><p>Cajun Navy leader David Flagg also spoke briefly, and together the group presented a united front. From the beginning, MNPD and the family have indicated that there'd been cooperation between them. The Cajun Navy's arrival earlier this week was met with a warm welcome publicly.</p><p>Flagg even thanked media for being respectful — something he said is rare in these types of cases. Collectively, the show of support "has given us faith" in humanity, Chris Whiteid said.</p><p><a href=#>Fox17</a> and <a href=#>WSMV</a> in Nashville both carried the press conference live. The family begins to speak at about the 3:30 mark&nbsp;in the above video.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>R.I.P.: 40 Country Singers and Songwriters Who Died Too Soon</h2><p>These country singers had so much more to give.
