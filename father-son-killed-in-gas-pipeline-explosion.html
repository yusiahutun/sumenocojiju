The workers attempted to use a second tractor to pull out the first tractor when the tractor struck the&nbsp;cross-country gas line as it sunk deeper into the ground, striking and cracking the underground pipeline.</p><p>Two men were pronounced dead at the scene, while two more were taken by medical helicopter to a Rockford hospital, where one is in critical condition while the other is listed in stable. Police say neighbors aided the two victims and took them to a local hospital from where they then flown to Rockford. The names of the victims are not yet being released.</p><p>The area is secure and safe, and there were no evacuations, although Illinois 38 was blocked for a time. Pipeline officials say a second large gas pipeline near the area was not damaged, and there was no loss of service. Because the pipeline is federally regulated, the NTSB will assist in the investigation.</p><p>—&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>MyStateline.com</strong></a></p><p><strong>EARLIER REPORT</strong></p><p>The Lee County Sheriff’s Office and Illinois State Police are responding to reports of a large explosion near Nachusa.</p><p>One witness at the scene&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>tells WTVO-TV</strong></a>&nbsp;a tractor hit a gas line there, creating the explosion.
