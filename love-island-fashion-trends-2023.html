We’re seeing this trend showcased by the likes of Bella Hadid and Pete Davidson - it’s a great way to really make a statement simply in the outfit. It’s all about crystal pieces paired with blazer dresses and effortless two pieces that create a blurred line between business and party.”</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Tutti Frutti</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9cb345666edf-lovetrends2-z.jpg><p id=e90uo7v2DQha data-wc=86>“This trend is all about colour and joy. It’s all about the pinks, yellows, oranges and blues, integrated in an explosion of neon blazers and bright two-pieces,” explains Amy, “Dopamine dressing is here to stay from the summer, it’s just gone up a notch. We are finding people are dressing to boost their mood, steering away from neutrals. The trend has been seen all over the runways, with pops of colour being worn by style-icon Hailey Bieber as she casually walks to get her morning coffee.”</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Dressed up Denim</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2c6df152a427-lovetrends3-z.jpg><p id=egiELE22-CsX data-wc=80>“Encouraging people to reflect on their shopping habits, this trend will bring to life the ways pre-loved denim can be upcycled to give pieces a new lease of life,” says Amy, “For the girls, it’s all about the classic co-ords and fitted jumpsuits, and for the boys, we’re going to be seeing loose fitting oversized shirts paired with long-length shorts. I’m excited about this trend, although it's such a classic, there are so many different ways you can wear denim”.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Heavy Metal</strong></h2><p id=ex6i-7ZD5_Lt><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dd9978cf0b8e-lovetrends4-z.jpg></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong><p id=eVINAXqtYGik data-wc=106>The last trend according to Amy is “Inspired by Kourtney and Travis.” She’s taking the Love Island wardrobe to the dark side, “Bringing back rebellious dressing with metallic skirts, leather jackets and vintage Ts, this trend feeds into both self-expression and showing pre-loved classics&nbsp; that will last a lifetime,” she explains. “This trend will pair classic heavy metal with current fashion. It’s all about cut out tops, using sparkly pieces to lift the looks, metallic skirts, sexy leather trousers and timeless leather bombers. We’ve seen it on the runway with designers going OTT with palettes and crystal fringing and we’ve seen it on the streets too.”</p><p id=ejKDpJK3puw6 data-wc=14></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue5FpaWxoYWZ%2BcoKQbmdvZ5ykw6Z5yKyjmqaUYrOiv8eipqdlpKeyr7DSZmlpamNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
