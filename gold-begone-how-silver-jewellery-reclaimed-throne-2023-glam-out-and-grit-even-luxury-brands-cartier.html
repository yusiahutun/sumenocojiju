4 contemporary jewellers pumping fresh blood into heart motifs
This was as true for mid-range brands (at Monica Vinader, sales of silver have increased by 26 per cent) as it has been in the luxury sphere."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Its rehabilitation has been slow but, since early 2023, the renaissance of the precious metal has got well and truly in motion.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">4 contemporary jewellers pumping fresh blood into heart motifs</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This was as true for mid-range brands (at Monica Vinader, sales of silver have increased by 26 per cent) as it has been in the luxury sphere. Even the second-hand market has felt the shift: according to second-hand e-commerce site Depop, searches for types of silver jewellery have been increasing by up to 300 per cent on a month-by-month basis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/19/70615d37-9b34-4c2a-8bf9-3cb0947226f2_2e52fe38.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Silver feels sleek, chic and gives an ode to the noughties style that’s been trending,” says jewellery designer Astley Clarke. “We love how silver can instantly elevate a look, giving something more to jeans and a T-shirt. For a modern, minimal look go for simple pieces, or just one hero ring and hoop earrings; and for more of a bold, edgy vibe, we’d go for chunky pieces at different lengths and widths to maximise on the trend.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The designer brands have paid attention: Bottega Veneta has a pair of sculptural, organic silver drop earrings that have featured in a number of high-end shoots, and Elsa Peretti’s creations for Tiffany & Co. have been bestsellers. Cartier now has more pieces available in white gold than it did last year, while Mejuri has had a clear focus on silver. And Isabel Marant arguably started the trend with a pair of sculpted chandelier earrings that fashion editors love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/19/418cfae0-10a5-4795-aeab-30a82be37512_80dd819f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Silver jewellery is making a major comeback and I couldn’t be more thrilled,” says designer Lucy Quartermaine. “The cool and smooth look of silver matches the trend of keeping things simple and stylish. When wearing silver, consider pairing it with cool-coloured clothing to enhance its shine.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Celebs from Kim K to Rihanna love oversized cross jewellery – should you?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Silver is certainly subtler than gold. “It is a bit less glam, but has a bit more grit than gold, and I feel like that is very 2023,” designer Lucy Williams – who has created a collection for Missoma in silver – has said. Silver also embodies the quiet luxury, stealth wealth trend that seems to have taken over fashion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/19/180f1658-126f-4567-a394-2778981d1f10_7baa2662.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And for those of us who are feeling as torn about leaving our gold jewellery behind as we did about bidding farewell to our skinny jeans a few years ago, worry not – there’s no need to put away all those golden necklaces, hoops and rings just yet; instead, pair them with a few pieces of silver for an instant update. According to those in the know, the contrast is now not only acceptable but actively encouraged.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I love mixing and matching silver with rose gold or gold pieces,” says Quartermaine. “It feels like one of the most trendy things you can do right now.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZqWtqKq%2FunvJnq6epJyav7p7wKuropucmnx0fpJxa3JuX5y8rbCMm5ygp56aeqm71maqoqSmmr9utsSwnKWklafGbr7EnKOaoZ2asW7Ax6ump51dZ31zf4ygo5qlXaTCtXnAp5tmn6KewW6x1Z6lZqSlrcKzxYybqZqmlKh6pK3RraCeqg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
