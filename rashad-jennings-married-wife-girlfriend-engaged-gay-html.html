When the occasion was supposed to be celebrated with loved ones, Rashed celebrated 2018's Valentine's Day with his fans and well-wishers.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Standing in&nbsp;Times Square, New York, the reality star&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">handed</a> out red roses, the symbol of love to his fans&nbsp;from&nbsp;11 a.m. to noon.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><img alt height=595 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/celebrity/rashad-jennings-withroses.JPG width=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Rashad Jenning gives away red roses to his fans on the occasion&nbsp;of 2018's&nbsp;Valentine's day</strong> (Photo:&nbsp;Rashad Jenning's Instagram) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Well, Rashad's&nbsp;special ones are not only his fans and well-wishers, but his mother is also special for him. He did not end 2018's Valentine right there in&nbsp;Times Square, New York but later sent&nbsp;a gift&nbsp;to his mother as well.&nbsp;</p><p>This was not the first time Rashad&nbsp;flaunted his affection for his parents as he does&nbsp;on numerous occasions and times.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Had Girlfriend Once; Mom's Stamp Of Approval</h2><p>Well, Rashad's mom is not just the constant lover and supporter of him but also the stamp approval of his girlfriend. Revealing in an interview with the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">PEOPLE</a>&nbsp;on 26th May 2017, the American personality disclosed that any woman that will come in his life has to be approved by his mother.&nbsp;</p><p>“My mom knows me very well and she knows anybody that I give the okay to be around, she’s gotta be okay."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>In the same interview, there came another big revelation that&nbsp;Rashad once had&nbsp;a longtime girlfriend. He also added that he was the one to propose her but later called it quits mutually with her. He said,&nbsp;</p><p>“We went through each other’s growing stages and phases and shared all of those moments with each other: mistakes, happy times, sad times."</p><p>Though the athlete disclosed that&nbsp;they separated back in 2014, the time when Rashad just joined the&nbsp;New York Giants, he&nbsp;did not open up the identity of&nbsp;his former love. For the reason of breakup, Rashad quoted “it was an accumulation of stuff” that came between&nbsp;their “wants and ambitions.” He was affected much by the split as he recalls the feelings as&nbsp;“a lot of emptiness.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, he channeled his energy by&nbsp;focusing on his dancing show, the book "The If In Life" and continued working on his&nbsp;Rashad Jennings Foundation, a non-profit&nbsp;foundation to help kids.</p><p>Keeping himself busy with all the works, Rashad&nbsp;seems to be currently&nbsp;enjoying his singlehood as no information of his dating has surfaced out in the media.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, he is not married and looks to be miles away from getting engaged and having a wife.&nbsp;Perhaps the footballer is waiting for a perfect match to show up in his life. Don't you think so as well?</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><a href=# rel=follow>Keep Visiting</a> as we keep you updated on the life of Rashad Jennings!</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZquZo52upXnJnqWnoZ6cwG65wKupop2UYsSqssRmnqKqnJu%2FqrHNnWSeppeWtKawjKCYsmaYqbqt</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
