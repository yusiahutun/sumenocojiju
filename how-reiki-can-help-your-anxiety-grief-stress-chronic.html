These blockages affect our physical, mental and emotional states.”<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mok isn’t the only one who’s benefited from Chu’s “healing hands”. In her 13 years as a reiki practitioner, Chu has helped people the world over deal with anxiety, grief, depression, trauma, chronic illness, mental fatigue and other physical and emotional problems.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Paralysed on one side, how ‘tough love’ gave reiki practitioner life</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She encourages her clients to bring their bodies back into balance by channelling “healing” energy towards them. This energy, which reiki practitioners believe comes from the universe, is thought to activate the receiver’s body to heal itself.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Reiki is a form of alternative therapy. It has its roots in Buddhist Sanskrit scriptures and was rediscovered by Japanese scholar and philosopher Mikao Usui in the late 19th century. According to Pervin Clasper, co-founder of Shakti Healing Circle in the Central business district on Hong Kong Island, reiki is translated as “universal life force” or, more simply, energy in motion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are surrounded by energy and we are energy, with every cell in our body constantly vibrating to it. The present form of reiki created by Usui gives us instant access to this life force to enhance our body’s natural ability to self-heal.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/06/10/c7461163-267f-41db-b8da-cb5ee2995ec7_435742c5.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Usui dedicated his life to finding a natural system of hands-on healing that anyone could learn so that they could apply healing to themselves or others. He drew his knowledge from multiple sources, including texts about science, religion and culture – although reiki has no religious doctrine.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It wasn’t until the early 1920s, while on a meditation retreat, that Usui felt overcome by a spiritual energy and realised the power of healing through gentle touch. In 1922, he established a reiki institute in Tokyo in Japan, where he offered healing sessions and taught reiki masters.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chu runs Corie Chu Healing, also in Central, and teaches the traditional form of Usui reiki. Before a session, she and her client discuss the issues they want to address and asks about what’s going on in their lives to get a clearer idea of how they’re feeling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/06/10/a3606fcb-2929-4574-a4ad-8406d5bb43b6_c660a79c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She then does an “energy scan” to assess which areas first need to be focused on. This will also determine which position is best for her client to rest in. Then the treatment begins – Chu places her hands on specific problem areas of her client’s clothed body and passes energy from the universe to them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Receivers don’t usually feel much during a session,” she points out. “Those who are naturally more energetically sensitive say that they feel the energy, in the form of warmth or extreme heat, moving through their body. Some feel tingles, while others may hear and feel gas bubbles popping in their body.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’ve also had clients who see images, colours or light travelling through their body, and clients who just get a strong sense of knowing that the treatment is working.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Eczema sufferer on her all-natural solution to beating her condition</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Most people come out of a reiki session feeling more relaxed, refreshed and inspired. Chu’s clients often say they feel lighter, as though a weight has been lifted.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This weight is the energetic and emotional waste that, up till that point, had yet to be cleared from their body.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chu stresses that reiki practitioners do not have an innate personal ability to heal, but rather, are channels for universal energy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/06/10/19ed0b56-1e1f-429d-aa62-af9635a7552f_acf7f18f.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/06/10/3d06684e-9994-4c78-99c0-858090d5bebb_435742c5.jpg>Clasper, who is a master teacher in traditional Usui reiki, says it works well in tandem with traditional Western medicine. In her 20-plus years of practice, she’s seen reiki help with a wide range of emotional, physical and mental issues, from headaches to <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">cancer</span></a> support. Clasper has had clients seek reiki for treating <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">eczema</span></a> that they’ve had for years, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">insomnia</span></a> and other problems that were causing them to feel “stuck”.While science has yet to recognise reiki, studies have shown that this energy-based healing technique may yield positive results. For instance, a review published in 2014 in the journal Pain Management Nursing suggested that reiki could help with <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">depression</span></a> and anxiety. A study published in 2011 in Oncology Nursing Forum found that chemotherapy patients who were administered reiki experienced a greater sense of well-being.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Reiki treatments are becoming increasingly accepted in hospitals, hospices and cancer support units around the world, including the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Hartford Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital in the United States.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">We tried new treatment for anxiety, allergies, chronic pain</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chu believes that reiki’s rising popularity is attributable to the growing interest in natural remedies and alternative therapies. It’s also a great way to deal with everyday stress. For those interested in exploring their spiritual side, reiki helps them do this safely, gently and effectively.</p>The practice invites self-care and is a wonderful way to learn more about ourselves, which coincides with the growing interest in well-being, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">mindfulness</span></a> and personal development. And finally, more people want to go back to what’s natural and organic when it comes to dealing with their ailments, and reiki aligns with that “back to basics” philosophy.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/06/10/1fb14d61-c755-431a-83f1-55e42d358cc4_798e21ed.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After experiencing the benefits of reiki first-hand, Mok decided to learn how to practise it on himself and others. He has completed his training for reiki levels one and two and says that it has come in handy, especially during the pandemic, when so many people are struggling emotionally and physically.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Much of the pain and discomfort we feel in our bodies come from deep-seated issues we haven’t been able to let go of, and reiki can help create healing in those areas of the body where we’re experiencing those energy blockages,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I use reiki to help myself and others where I can – it allows me to identify the issues in my life that I haven’t been dealing with. This, in turn, helps me live more intentionally and continue being of service to others.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLWmrcutn2avlaG5r7HSrGaaqqSesK2xjmxobG5nbYRwtM6wZKudmaC2bq%2FAp2ShnZylerq71KtkmqaonrK1xYygqaKdlmLAtb7ErKpmm5invK%2B1wg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
