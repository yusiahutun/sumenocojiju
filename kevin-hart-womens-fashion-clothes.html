You can tell a lot about people by their appearance. Good style in a woman is about her being herself. It's about being able to bring your own flair and attitude to your clothing. It's not just about what you think is cool, it's what you make cool. That's the difference. The women who understand that always dress in such a unique way. It doesn't look forced. You believe it."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Good style in a woman is about her being herself. It's about being able to bring your own flair and attitude to your clothing. It's not just about what you think is cool, it's what you make cool. That's the difference. The women who understand that always dress in such a unique way. It doesn't look forced. You believe it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="kicker css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now, you can't go wrong with a basic sundress because it leaves so much to the imagination. The great thing about when a woman has a sundress on is that when she walks it looks like she has curves no matter what.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="kicker css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When sundress weather ends how does a woman look sexy in the fall or winter? It's a woman who looks very put together. You can't beat that. By "put together" I mean a woman who knows how to dress and layer. Get a nice leather coat with a scarf, and you have that little red nose because it's cold outside. That's cute. Add nice little boots? That's sexy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="kicker css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><span>You always want to look comfortable. You don't ever want to dress so that you can't have a good time. It should never be, "Look at me, my clothes are so nice, but I can't move my neck." You need to make sure you come off classy but at the same time like a person who can hold a conversation and go out and have fun. You need to look like you can go throw a bowling ball if someone asked you.</span></p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"In 2016, I shouldn't have to encounter no damn clogs."<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="kicker css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Essentially, you should be able to turn it on and off. Every day doesn't have to be a drop-dead gorgeous day. You should be able to be that drop-dead gorgeous girl when you're dressing up and when you're dressing down. Pants and Chucks can come off as just as great as a formfitting dress. A woman who can find that balance—meaning my wife—those are amazing women.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="kicker css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><span>You can tell a lot about a woman by the way she manages her underwear. That thing when a girl sits down and has jeans on and you can see the underwear line at the top—no good.</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="kicker css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Women also never look good wearing clogs. I don't know what it is about clogs; I think it's the name and the sound they make that makes me mad. Luckily I don't encounter them that often. In 2016, I shouldn't have to encounter no damn clogs.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="kicker css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Beyoncé has always been a fashion juggernaut. I remember meeting her and thinking how well dressed she was. She had on a business suit, but it was different from anything everyone else had on. I thought, "That's how you make a statement." Ciara's fashion is incredible, and Rita Ora's red-carpet looks are really nice. Kim Kardashian is also a hell of a dresser. She always throws it on. You have to give credit where credit is due.</p><img alt="Clothing, Hat, Outerwear, Formal wear, Style, Flooring, Dress, Carpet, Waist, Fashion model, " title="Clothing, Hat, Outerwear, Formal wear, Style, Flooring, Dress, Carpet, Waist, Fashion model, " width=4000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/41/1476223715-hbz-kevin-hart-embed.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">BFA/Getty</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="kicker css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As a man, you should encourage your woman to be creative and to experiment. You should never limit a person to what they can or cannot do. If experimenting with your look is your way of being creative, my job as a man is to support that and love you regardless.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="kicker css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But no one should ever wear Hammer pants.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="folio css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kevin Hart's new film, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://www.kevinhartwhatnow.com/?gclid=CjwKEAjwm_K_BRDx5o-sxq6ouXASJAC7TsFLRBOhOJH1q-v-a7Qxjzf8oZSNN7-IiI-JQ_pjAj5u7RoCDSbw_wcB" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kevin Hart: What Now?" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Kevin Hart: What Now?</a>, is in theaters now.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="folio css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>This article originally appeared in the November 2016 issue of Harper's BAZAAR.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGielZbBtr7ErGaaaWdugHF7yp6toqZdna6zwIywpqadnqh6p63SoaCopl2YubDAx56qaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
