The infidelity might also be the reason why their marriage ended! But Ryan, who had been married once to Heather Boyajian, should know better than to destroy a happy married life.</span></p><p><span>So, while we wait for the truth to surface, let’s learn all about Ryan Boyajian’s ex-wife.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Heather Boyajian, Ryan Boyajian Ex-Wife</b></h3><p><span>Heather Boyajian is Ryan Boyajian’s ex-wife.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As per the reports, it was Ryan who filed for a Marriage Dissolution/Divorce back on October 23, 2012, at </span><i><span>Orange County Superior Courts</span></i><span>. However, the reason behind their separation wasn’t shared.</span></p><p><span>Their divorce was finalized in July 2017.</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, we have no information about Heather’s relationship status thereafter.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, Ryan was making waves with his relationship with the RHOC star Jennifer Pedranti in 2023. Rumors had that Ryan and Jennifer were intimate while the latter was still married to her husband William Pedranti — which ultimately led to their divorce.</span></p><p><span>Court documents cited William filed for divorce after 18 years of marriage due to irreconcilable differences and listed a separation date of January 3, 2021. In his filing, he asked the court to award joint legal and physical custody of their five kids and also demanded that his separate property be awarded to him</span></p><p><span>Jennifer, for her part, did not dispute the case.</span></p><p><span>So, both William and Jennifer were good as long as the former paid spousal support.</span></p><p><span>Thanks to the rumors, Jennifer’s friendship with her co-star Tamra Judge was also faltering as Jennifer met Ryan at </span><i><span>Cut Fitness</span></i><span> (which was owned by Tamra). The duo reportedly met between late 2021 to early 2022. However, they only shared their images on Instagram as early as July 2022.</span></p><p><span>“I’m so grateful for the love and support you give us. You are a constant by my side, my ride or die, my best friend.. and whatever the occasion may be we always make it SO incredibly fun,” Jennifer dedicated an IG post to her new boo.</span></p><h3><b>Ryan And Heather Boyajian Kids</b></h3><p><span>Heather Boyajian and Ryan share two kids — Cole and Tyler. They turned 19 and 17 on November 26, and July 30, 2022, respectively.</span></p><p><span>Their son, Cole Boyajian graduated from </span><i><span>JSerra Catholic High School</span></i><span> in 2022 and started working as a setter at </span><i><span>Solar Consultant</span></i><span>. There, his job was to go door to door prequalifying houses, and set up appointments for a solar consultation.</span></p><p><span>Whilst Cole’s employed at </span><i><span>Solar Consultant</span></i><span>, he was also pursuing his Bachelor of Business Administration at </span><i><span>Point Loma Nazarene University</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>“What motivates me as a first-year college student at Point Loma Nazarene University is putting in time and effort to be the best student I can be and make a difference in the world. I’m skilled in math and accounting and enjoy speaking,” he wrote.</span></p><p><span>As for their daughter, Tyler was just focusing on her studies. Find her on IG @</span><a href=#><span>tylerrboyajianC</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Talking about their kids, Ryan said, Cole always raised the bar and continued to lead by example as he radiate kindness. While his “Angel girl,” Tyler was “an amazingly beautiful and strong young woman.”</span></p><p><span>Like Ryan, Jennifer also has 5 kids. “My ex-husband, Will, is living in Oklahoma, working for my family’s business. Instead of moving the kids back and forth all the time, when he comes in town, I go stay at Ryan’s and then he’s in the house. Do I understand it’s weird? Yes. But it is just how we’re navigating it right now,” the star shared.</span></p><h3><b>Heather Boyajian Age</b></h3><p><span>Heather Boyajian was 47 years of age in 2023.</span></p><p><span>She is the same age as her ex-husband Ryan.</span></p><h3><b>What Is Heather Boyajian Maiden Name?</b></h3><p><span>Heather Boyajian’s maiden name is “Novak.”</span></p><p><span>After the divorce, Heather still goes by the name Heather Novak Boyajian.</span></p><h3><b>Heather Boyajian Job</b></h3><p><span>Heather Boyajian is a Technical Assistant.
