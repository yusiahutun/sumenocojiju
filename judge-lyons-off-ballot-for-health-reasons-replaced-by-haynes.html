In May, the Board of Supervisors voted 4-1 to appoint Haynes — an Ellisville attorney — to fill in for Lyons while he was out on medical leave. Lyons was already on the ballot for the Republican primary by then and did not have a challenger in that race.</p><p>“There is a possibility that I may require further treatment to address existing complications,” Lyons wrote. “Given the current circumstances, I have made the difficult decision to withdraw my candidacy .... My health must take precedence in this season so that I may continue to prioritize my longevity and advocacy for justice.</p><p>“I have devoted considerable time to championing the rights of others. My aspiration has been to serve as a voice for those who are marginalized and lack representation. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve the people of Jones County as Justice Court Judge of District 3 for the past 25-plus years.”</p><p>There was some dispute among GOP committee members about who the nominee should be, sources with knowledge of the discussions said. Some wanted Aaron Parker, a former deputy who is now an attorney and resides in District 3. Some favored Parker because he lives in District 3, even though that is not a requirement for serving in the position.</p><p>Supervisors were at odds for the same reason back in May, when they appointed Haynes. During the nomination process, Supervisors Larry Dykes and David Scruggs voted for Haynes while Supervisors Johnny Burnett and Travares Comegys picked Noel Rogers and District 3 Supervisor Phil Dickerson pushed for Parker. On the re-vote after the tie, all except Dickerson selected Haynes.</p><p>Final ballots for the general election have to be submitted by next week, when absentee balloting begins, so the process had to be hastened to meet that deadline. The party’s executive committee followed the process for putting a replacement on the ballot and submitted the paperwork to the Secretary of State’s office, committee members said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcLbUnZ6eZZyuvK%2B%2FjKidn2WSlrmtu9NmnaiqXZ2yorjToWSrnZGovK%2B%2FjKucqaSRmLKlecGyZKGZqaOytHvAq6uim5yarHKulXBsapxoYoJ6g8NmaGqdlWKFpH2YZpibnmVuhKWEl25qnGaYqbqt</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
