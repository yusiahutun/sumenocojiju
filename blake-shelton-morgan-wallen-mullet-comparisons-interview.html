See the full clip of him talking about Wallen's mullet below.</p><p><strong>What's Up With Morgan Wallen's Mullet?</strong></p><p>This isn't the first time someone has asked Shelton about Wallen and his hair. In the early '00s,&nbsp;Shelton sported a long, dark mullet on many of his album covers and along every red carpet he walked. It began to get progressively shorter toward the middle of the decade — Shelton too had a bob at one point — until disappearing while he was in a relationship with Miranda Lambert.</p><p>A year ago, Shelton said he was going to grow it back, but he didn't get very far into that endeavor.</p><p>"For me, you can't be fat and have a mullet," he told the <a href=#>Bobby Bones Show</a> earlier this month. During that same interview, he mostly complimented Wallen, calling him a good-looking guy while praising his career.&nbsp;So, this latest comment was most likely in jest.</p><p>Longtime fans of both&nbsp;artists may recall&nbsp;that they competed elsewhere prior to competing for best hair&nbsp;and space on country airplay charts. In 2014, Wallen was on <a href=#>The Voice</a>,&nbsp;first on Team Usher and then Team Adam. He was cut before becoming a finalist.</p><p><strong>See Country Stars From The Voice, Then and Now:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmm6SRoLJuv8eeo62nnmK6sL7GmqVmr5Ghuaa6jKaspaSVqXqku8ypmKuho6S7tHnIp6ueqqaesrh7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
