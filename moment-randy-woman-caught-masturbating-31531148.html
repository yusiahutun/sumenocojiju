I was just stressed out."</p><p>Revels-Glick claimed it only took her 20 seconds to finish the raunchy act. But that didn't matter. She broke down in tears as police handcuffed her. Footage of the arrest racked up millions of views after it was released.</p><p>She initially asked the police: “What did I do? What did I do?" When the officers revealed their reasoning, she replied: "Who saw that?" One cop said: "A couple of people."</p><p>Revels-Glick then denied the reasoning and started acting out what she was apparently doing, which she said was just lying on the towel.
