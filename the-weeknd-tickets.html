World Food Programme’s food assistance to communities in countries like Ukraine, Ethiopia, Madagascar and Yemen. “The goal with this fund is to provide immediate life-saving support to people who are on the brink of starvation. I’m so thankful to have WFP as a partner and to further expand our reach to those who need it most,” The Weeknd said in a statement at the time.</p><p>On September 3, 2022, The Weeknd cancelled his concert at Sofi Stadium in Inglewood, California, after losing his voice minutes into his performance. “I can’t give you the concert I want to give you,” he told his audience that night before exiting the stage. “I’m going to make sure everyone’s good, gets your money back, and I’ll do a show real soon for you guys, but I wanted to come out and personally apologize and not tweet it or Instagram it,” he continued, visibly shaken. “I wanted you guys to know that I can’t give you what I want to give you. I apologize. I’m so sorry.” The Weeknd rescheduled the cancelled date for November 26 and November 27, 2022, with tickets on sale now.</p><p>So where can fans buy <a href=# rel=noopener>The Weeknd</a> tickets?

However, it’s expected that most of the setlist will include songs from his fourth studio album, After Hours—which was released in March 2020 and hit number one on the Billboard 200 chart—as well as his fifth studio album, Dawn FM, which was released in January 2022 and reached number two on the Billboard 200 chart.</span></p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> in 2020, The Weeknd explained how the title of After Hours&nbsp;came about. “Oh, there are so many reasons for it. The main reason is these are all emotions and thoughts and feelings that I had late at night — [like the video] is all one night and I’m going through all the emotions, after the club, after the fight and after a long day, it’s like these are my thoughts from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m,” he said. “‘After Hours’ the song is absolutely my thoughts at 4 a.m., alone, after everything is done. And the movie, of course. Anyway, this is the last song.”</p><p>He also explained how the album was inspired by him turning 30. “I’ve always been self-destructive. I’ve never brought harm to others, my problem was always hurting myself,” he said. “So at 30 I realized I’m genuinely happy, I have my family, my friends, my company, I’m making the smartest <a href=# id=auto-tag_music data-tag=music>music</a> I’ve ever made, and I feel like my career is just starting. This is the beginning of another phase — not just a chapter but my second decade. A song like “Faith,” which is so misleading in the title [laughs], the religion aspect of it is … everything is a test, and if you are religious or spiritual you have to go through things.”</p><p>See below for the full After Hours and Dawn FM track lists.</p><p><strong>After Hours</strong></p><li class=p1><span class=s1>Alone Again</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>Too Late</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>Hardest To Love</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>Scared To Live</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>Snowchild</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>Escape From L.A.</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>Heartless</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>Faith</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>Blinding Lights</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>In Your Eyes</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>Save Your Tears</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>Repeat After Me (Interlude)</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>After Hours</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>Until I Bleed Out</span></li><p><strong>Dawn FM</strong></p><li class=p1><span class=s1>Dawn FM</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>Gasoline</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>How Do I Make You Love Me?</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>Take My Breath</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>Sacrifice</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>A Tale by Quincy</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>Out of Time</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>Here We Go… Again</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>Best Friends</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>Is There Someone Else?</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>Starry Eyes</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>Every Angel Is Terrifying</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>Don’t Break My Heart</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>I Heard You’re Married</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>Less Than Zero</span></li><li class=p1><span class=s1>Phantom Regret by Jim</span></li><h2>Who is The Weeknd’s After Hours til Dawn Stadium Tour opening act?</h2><p>The Weeknd announced that his March 2022 that his After Hours til Dawn Stadium Tour opening act was Doja Cat, who won the Grammy for Pop Duo/Group Performance for “Kiss Me More” with SZA in 2022 and is best known for songs like “Say So” (which hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2020), “Woman” and “Get Into It (Yuh).” The Weeknd is also featured on “You Right” from Doja’s third studio album, Planet Her.</p><p>“I made the song and then I didn’t think I was going to get anybody on it. I knew that I wanted The Weeknd on this album, but we didn’t know what to do,” Doja told NME in 2021 of “You Right.” “We played him one song, and we thought it was the perfect song but it ended up not working. Then he heard this other song but it had already been finished with two verses, but he was obsessed with it.”</p><p>In May 2022, Doja Cat announced that she would no longer be a part of The Weeknd’s tour due to a tonsil surgery. “Unfortunately I have to have surgery on my tonsils ASAP. The surgery is routine but the recovery is going to take awhile due to swelling. That means I have to cancel my festival run this summer as well as The Weeknd tour. I feel horrible about this but can’t wait for this to heal and get back to making music and create an experience for y’all,” she tweeted at the time.</p><p>See below for a list of The Weeknd’s past opening acts.</p><p><strong>The King of the Fall Tour (2014)</strong></p><ul><li>ScHoolboy Q</li><li>Jhené Aiko</li></ul><p><strong>The Madness Fall Tour (2015)</strong></p><ul><li>Banks</li><li>Travis Scott</li><li>Halsey</li></ul><p><strong>Starboy: Legend of the Fall Tour (2017)</strong></p><ul><li>Lil Uzi Vert</li><li>Bryson Tiller</li><li>Rae Sremmurd</li><li>Belly</li><li>6lack</li><li>Cezinando</li><li>Gucci Mane</li><li>Nav</li><li>French Montana</li></ul><p><strong>The Weeknd Asia Tour (2018)</strong></p><ul><li>Kenshi Yonezu</li></ul><p>The Weeknd tickets to the After Hours til Dawn Stadium Tour are still available on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">VividSeats.com</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">StubHub.com</a>.
