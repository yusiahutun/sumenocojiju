Find out Here!</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-03-08</div><p>Never was there a more tumultuous relationship than <a href=#>Grey’s Anatomy</a>‘s central couple, Meredith (played by <a href=#>Ellen Pompeo</a>) and Derek (played by <a href=#>Patrick Dempsey</a>)! The relationship between student and teacher (or in this case surgical intern and attending) kept fans on the edge of their seats week after week and year after year. Will they or won’t they? Are they going to get married or break up? Will <a href=#>Derek</a> finally pick, choose, and love <a href=#>Meredith</a>, therefore, making our MerDer loving hearts whole again?!</p><p>Well, yes, he did pick her (after he picked <a href=#>Addison</a> but that’s neither here nor there). He did choose her. He did love her… and then, he cheated on her. Okay, well that’s not entirely fair. In his defense, he did push the doctor who kissed him away and professed to loving his wife. But, that doesn’t mean the scene didn’t feel like a dagger to our hearts. Check out the Season 11 scene below!</p><p></p><p>Ugh, we despise her. We can barely remember who she was but we despise her. To refresh your memory, the surgical resident in question who took it upon herself to embrace Derek in a liplock was a doctor from Washington DC — remember when Mer and Der tried the whole long distance thing? Well, Dr. Renee Collier tried to get in-between the iconic couple but Derek aka McDreamy wasn’t about to let that happen.</p><p>“I thought DC was everything, and I was wrong. You. You, you’re everything,” he told Meredith in the episode. “I love you, and I’m not gonna stop loving you. Meredith, I can’t live without you. I don’t want to live without you. And I’m going to do everything in my power to prove it.” And how does she respond? “I can live without you. But I don’t want to. I don’t ever want to.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/meredith-derek-getty.jpg><p>Photo Credit: Getty Images</p><p>Ah, now that’s the MerDer we know and love. The couple is notorious for being opposites: Derek wants to be Meredith’s white knight and is full of romantic optimism while Meredith spent most of her life being dark and twisty and not believing in true love. Apart they’re ordinary but together they’re extraordinary. Even though Mer’s other half <a href=#>isn’t on the show</a> anymore (RIP Derek), we know that their love lives on.</p><p>Join our <a href=#>Facebook group</a> for the latest news and updates on Grey’s Anatomy!</p><p><strong>For more hot celebrity news, listen to Us Weekly editors dish on top topics & trends with these clips from the Hot Hollywood Podcast!<strong><br></strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46doJ1llJq%2FpreMnJ%2BemaRivK95zJ6pnpyZqbVutc1mqp6Zo6S7bn2QZqafZZensrp50maYp5mkpLq6eZBtaWptaGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
