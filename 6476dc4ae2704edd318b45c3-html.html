Weeks after telling the media she had a funny story to share about <strong>Miami Heat's</strong> star, <strong>Coco Gauff,</strong> young American professional tennis player, finally revealed it to the media. According to the runner-up of the most recent French Open, <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Butler</strong></a> assured her that Heat was going to be in the <strong>NBA Finals</strong> even before they made it to the playoffs.</p><p>After defeating the Spanish Rebeka Masarova on the first round at <strong>Roland Garros, Coco Gauff </strong>attended a press conference and speak up about the promise <strong>Jimmy Butler</strong> made her via messages.</p><p>Since she's an avid <strong>Miami Heat</strong> fan, during the first days of April 'Jimmy Buckets' asked her if she wanted tickets for the team's postseason games. I said, 'I won't be here. I'll be in Madrid and then Rome and then France. And then he said, 'OK, when we make the Finals, let me know if your family wants some tickets.' So this was before they were even in the playoffs", she recalled.</p><p><strong>Coco Gauff</strong> remarked the confidence <strong>Jimmy Butler</strong> projected when he told her that. "Everybody was like, 'they have a 3% chance of making the Finals', but when he sent me that, I knew they were making the Finals, because he didn't say 'IF we make the Finals'... <strong>he said 'WHEN we make the Finals'",</strong> the 19-year-old tennis star detailed.</p><p>Finally, Jimmy's determination was proven when <strong>Miami Heat</strong> defeated<strong> Milwaukee Bucks,</strong> the Eastern Conference leader, in the first round. Then proceeded to beat<strong> New York Knicks,</strong> and finally eliminate <strong>Boston Celtics</strong> to become <strong>Conference champions.</strong></p><p>"So that's my '<strong>Jimmy Butler</strong> story.' He pretty much said we were going to the Finals before we even qualified for the playoffs, and I just really like that mentality",<strong>Coco Gauff</strong> concluded.</p><p>The number 6 in the WTA ranking will be facing Austrian <strong>Julia Grabher</strong> on Thursday, during the second round of <strong>Roland Garros. Miami Heat</strong> and <strong>Jimmy Butler</strong> will start their participation in the <a href=#><strong>NBA Finals</strong> against <strong>Denver Nuggets</strong></a> later that same day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jpuYrKOVqa%2BiuMtopZuZX6K2ornIZp%2BemaRkf3F%2BkmhnbmdjZnx3gJZvm5xskZp%2FeHyTnpuda2Ftr3WBwmxloaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
