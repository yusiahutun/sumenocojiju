They simply clean out their closets.”</p><p>Project Outrun Iowa, based in the Quad Cities and the first official chapter of the non-profit Project Outrun, was started eight months ago and has already designed shoes for 35 kids.</p><p>The organization also partnered with Dance Marathon at the University of Iowa to customize shoes for 24 children who have survived or are battling cancer. More families receiving treatment at the Stead Family Children’s Hospital in Iowa City have requested custom shoes.</p><p>The organization will earn money based on the weight of shoes donated, which are purchased by Fund2Orgs and sent to developing countries. Fleet Feet, the title sponsor, will match a portion of the donations.</p><p>People are encouraged to donate as many pairs as possible of gently worn, used, or new shoes at the following locations during normal business hours:</p><ul><li>Fleet Feet at 4257 Elmore Avenue in Davenport</li><li>Bettendorf Family Museum at 2900 Learning Campus Drive in Bettendorf</li><li>Palmer Hills Golf Course at 2999 Middle Road in Bettendorf</li><li>TBK Sports Complex at 4850 Competition Drive in Bettendorf</li></ul><p>Project Outrun was started in Akron, Ohio, by Andy Sheppard in 2016 when he ran a 5K to benefit Kylie Rose, who was battling pediatric cancer. Andy thought, “If Kylie is going to outrun cancer she needs the right shoes,” which inspired a custom designed pair for her.</p><p>Over 950 pairs have since been designed for kids across the country.</p><p>For more information about the shoe drive, you can contact Anthony Long, Director of Project Outrun Iowa, at (563) 579-4032 or by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>email</a>.</p><p>To learn more about Project Outrun, visit this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2020/11/Shoe-Drive-Flyer.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaKerp5qasLV5zq6rq62eYraww8BmmqiknJqwtbXNoGSsoJ%2BawG7AzmaZnqaVm7a1ecKhoKWcopq7bq7ArauloZ6ceqStzZycq2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
