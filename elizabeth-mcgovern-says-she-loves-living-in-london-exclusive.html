“It was never my intention to leave America,” Elizabeth McGovern exclusively told Closer Weekly in the magazine’s latest issue, on newsstands now, at the recent NYC premiere of her new movie The Chaperone. Yet after she married British writer-director Simon Curtis (My Week With Marilyn) in 1992, Illinois-born Elizabeth, 57, relocated to the U.K.
There she’s found professional success — most notably in the smash TV series Downton Abbey, soon to be back on the big screen — and personal happiness as the mother of now-grown daughters Matilda and Grace."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And I really didn’t listen to anyone’s advice. I just went my own way, which isn’t always the right thing to do, but, for better or for worse, that’s what I did.”</p><p>The Juilliard-trained actress soon found a place that she could call “home” upon arriving in Europe. “Hollywood never suited me, I didn’t ever feel comfortable with it, it took me a couple of years but I found where I was always meant to be … Chiswick!” Elizabeth laughed. “That’s it … Chiswick High Road, that was where I was always meant to be.”</p><p>For more on Elizabeth McGovern, pick up the latest issue of Closer Weekly, on newsstands now — and be sure to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable>sign up for our newsletter</a>&nbsp;for more exclusive news!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46eo6KykZeytbSMppqgp6aav6950pqwrGWjnbJuuM6vnKxlnJ7DqrrGZqCnZZyku6W7zWacsZucqsCqwsRo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
