The singer-slash-actress-slash-businesswoman (so many things) has been inspiring our purchases for years — decades, even — and whenever she steps out in a tight crop top or an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>oversized sweatsuit</a>, we can't help but wish we could raid her closet, even just for a minute. Lopez always manages to wear the best outfits.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Part of the reason J.Lo's looks are so flawless is because of a team of stylists, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Rob Zangardi</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Mariel Haenn</a>, who work hard to put her in pieces that hug every curve, provide a splash of sparkle or color, and stay in our memory for years to come. Another part is that when Lopez likes something, she makes sure it stays in her rotation. Over the years, she's developed a signature style, and has a few key pieces that she frequently rewears.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After discovering Lopez's fashion repeats, we decided to compile 20 style rules that the star tends to stick to. No matter your body type, age, or budget, you might just learn a thing or two — and find the solution to a future fashion dilemma — ahead.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-1-you-cant-got-wrong-with-a-crop-top></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>1.

Lopez has been wearing large ones for years, but tinier versions can easily work for everyday wear.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-3-show-some-leg-with-a-super-high-slit></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>3.

But J.Lo is the queen of this move — that first look is from 2011! — and, quite honestly, we're wowed every time.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-4-when-in-doubt-go-matchy-matchy></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>4.

You could go the simple route, matching a solid top to the same colored skirt or pants, or be more daring, like how Lopez styled her snakeskin dress with snakeskin boots.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-5-know-that-neutrals-can-stand-out></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>5.

She's proven that going neutral can actually make quite the statement, especially when you style your outfit with matching shoes and accessories, or work in a few metallics.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-6-embrace-uggs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>6.

Considering they're super comfy and even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>look great with skirts and dresses</a>, we're sold.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-7-go-ahead-and-take-the-plunge></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>7.

(Just make sure to pack plenty of double-sided tape.) Revisiting some of the singer's most iconic looks, it seems that whenever she goes with a deep V-neck, she sticks with longer lengths on the bottom to provide a bit of balance.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-8-hats-can-be-fancy-too></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>8.

Between these examples and ones provided by royals (they love a hat, too), it's at least worth testing out a beret or something floppy at a future formal event.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-9-coordinate-your-cup></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>9.

It adds some fun, fashionable flair to an otherwise mundane item, and we're betting it helps as a reminder to stay hydrated, too.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-10-invest-in-over-the-knee-boots></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>10.

She's been wearing this shoe style for years, and is particularly fond of the color black. Considering how versatile these babies are, we don't envision her stopping anytime soon.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-11-turtlenecks-are-actually-sexy></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>11.

You don't have to show off your full stomach: Letting a little bit of skin peek through, like the outfit in the middle, is the perfect balance between playful and practical.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-12-a-curve-hugging-midi-skirt-is-a-closet-staple></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>12.

Headed to an office? Pair it with a button-down. Going out for the night? Throw on a tank top. We're sure that J.Lo is well aware of all this versatility, which is why she continues to keep this skirt style in rotation.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-13-and-so-is-a-long-sleeved-bodycon-dress></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>13. ...And So Is a Long-Sleeved Bodycon Dress</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Long, short, patterned, complete with cutouts — there are so many different variations of this one item, and all of them — all of them — are meant to make subtle, sexy statement.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-14-a-belt-makes-all-the-difference></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>14.

Lopez has used belts to accentuate her curves (and even her baby bump), and they help to make her outfits a bit more interesting, too.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-15-say-yes-to-sweatsuits></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>15.

If these sets are styled right — like with cute accessories and a sleek pair of sneakers— they'll come off as elevated, rather than lazy.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-16-dont-shy-away-from-sequins></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>16.

Rather, she wears sequins whenever she can, and frequently goes for the silver variety. Of course, she also taught us that it doesn't need to be nighttime in order to step out in these ensembles — sequins are just as fun during the day, too.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-17-try-one-shouldered-styles></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>17.

It's a great way to switch things up when heading out, and the good news is, one-shouldered tops continue to trend.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-18-find-your-signature-shades></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_79-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>18.

But thanks to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a recent Coach campaign</a>, her signature sunglasses style can be yours.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-19-animal-prints-can-be-elevated></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_83-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>19.
