Chita was born Dolores Conchita Figueroa del Rivero in 1933 to a Puerto Rican father and a Scottish-Irish mother.
“I was raised Catholic, and I’ve often said I have two angels — Chita and Dolores — one on each shoulder,” the Tony Awards Lifetime Achievement recipient continued."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The body might change, but the heart remains constant.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The talented entertainer has certainly had a career full of highs. Her journey to stardom began in her teen years when she attended one of the most renowned dance schools in the U.S. — the School of American Ballet. “One step, one plié, led to another — and, ultimately, Broadway,” </span><i><span>The New Dick Van Dyke Show</span></i><span> alum said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Chita landed a number of breakthrough roles on some of the Big Apple’s most iconic stages. In 1957, she was cast as Anita in </span><i><span>West Side Story.</span></i><span> The plot of the musical had a very deep and emotional impact on the community at the time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“It was a job but became something so much bigger, in part because that musical was ripped from the headlines,” Chita said. “Somebody had just been killed at a playground down the street — the article was pinned to a board near the theater entrance. ‘This is your life,’ I thought.”</span></p><p><span>The songstress also appeared in </span><i><span>Bye Bye Birdie</span></i><span>, Bob Fosse’s </span><i><span>Chicago, Bring Back Birdie </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Merlin</span></i><span> before winning her first Tony Award for her role in </span><i><span>The Rink</span></i><span> alongside </span><a href=#><b>Liza Minnelli</b></a><span> in 1984. After pulling off a number of unforgettable portrayals throughout her 70 years as a performer, Chita couldn’t imagine having life any other way.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I would be so selfish to have wanted any other roles, because I’ve had so many great ones: Anita, Velma in </span><i><span>Chicago</span></i><span>, the title role in </span><i><span>Kiss of the Spider Woman</span></i><span>,” she reflected, before jokingly adding, “I’m pretty satisfied, but there are five Tony’s out there that should have been mine!”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46cn6KskWK%2FqsLEq5hmcWCptW6uyKuroZyRrnqzscWlnJyso2K8r3nGq5yarF2nvK2x0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
