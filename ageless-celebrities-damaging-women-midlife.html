No sense in that here was one of the world's most beautiful women and yet even she wasn't deemed perfect enough for public consumption. And total sense in that I had mentally wrestled, since the purchase of my first magazine with how these models could be literally flawless.</p><p id=eMfoA_bKiDD data-wc=33>That was the mid-90s and my first experience of retouching. Back then it was done by hand and only available to 0.001% of the genetically privileged to make them look even more so.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fa1d5b923e87-rosie-green-jeans.png><p id=emwCQNYvYzp data-wc=82>Now we can all improve our God given looks so easily, be it using filters on Instagram, fiddling with Photoshop on our computers and even Facetuning for the really advanced. Plus, thanks to the evolution of digital imagery, we also have the benefit of being able to take a gazillion pictures of ourselves from different angles in different lights till we look our absolute best. Back when it cost you £15 to develop your photos at Boots this was not an option.&nbsp;</p><p id=eL4t-mufGKQn data-wc=47>Research shows that constant exposure to idealised beauty images damages self-esteem. We (rightly) think a lot about how this affects teenagers. They find their faces lacking when presented all the time with beautiful people on their phones. Beautiful people who've been digitally manipulated to be more so.&nbsp;</p><p id=eY6mqM7mB_15 data-wc=8>But it's hard for anyone getting older too.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">More from Rosie</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I've finally got time for style now my kids are older – but which fashion tribe do I belong to?" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/71a4e0ce2c11-img8853.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I've finally got time for style now my kids are older – but which fashion tribe do I belong to?" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I've finally got time for style now my kids are older – but which fashion tribe do I belong to?</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="What divorce taught me about keeping desire alive" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/fa1d5b923e87-rosie-green-jeans.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="What divorce taught me about keeping desire alive" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>What divorce taught me about keeping desire alive</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="How investing in new underwear gave me a confidence boost in my 40s" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/666bd7624da1-b465fae0-e590-489e-a304-4667075441d100000718still004.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="How investing in new underwear gave me a confidence boost in my 40s" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>How investing in new underwear gave me a confidence boost in my 40s</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e1x1bZPq85iL data-wc=34>There’s a slew of celebrities who seem to be preserved in aspic. JLo, Salma Hayek, Demi Moore, Jennifer Connelly, Sandra Bullock, to name but a few. But how does this make us grown-ups feel?</p><p id=ed8BqFI1O6mS data-wc=11>To quote a David Guetta song, "It's complicated, it always&nbsp;is."</p><p id=erTUGta_qYMy data-wc=13><strong>&nbsp;READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>I'm a divorcee and Bennifer gave me unrealistic expectations about blended families &nbsp;</a></p><p id=ezoHMvu2kjKa data-wc=43>There is a positive to seeing older women smashing it on the red carpet, looking sexy and stylish. It makes us feel that once you hit 40 and beyond, you are not consigned to a life of invisibility, sensible haircuts and elasticated waistbands.&nbsp;</p><p id=ecjaw5CJJ0hk data-wc=76>But equally there is a disappointment that you don't have their cinched waist, wrinkle-free skin or snatched jawline. Throw in the fact celebs often doctor their image on social media to look even more youthful and the disparity between them and us becomes even wider. Plus, they know all the posing tricks, their best angles and, when they know they are likely to be photographed, often ensure there is someone on hand with large flattering light.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/71a4e0ce2c11-img8853.jpg><p id=eEuAESx1WCtQ data-wc=28>This means that sometimes there's so much difference between a picture of a celeb that’s taken off guard and one that is posed, reality can make you gasp.</p><p id=eANYQ4deU7DO data-wc=39>There's a paparazzi picture of SJP doing the rounds where she looks, well, her age. It feels unsisterly to look, but when you do there's a sense of relief that A-listers are not immune from the ravages of time.&nbsp;</p><p id=eXSU-Vxojt data-wc=10><strong>INSPIRATION:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>I'm happier than ever at 49 - here's how</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eWm1d356qx5I data-wc=16>Ditto it's good to see women who look their age and are both inspiring and content.&nbsp;</p><p id=eIrQruSV-jv_ data-wc=18>I'm thinking of Annette Bening, Jodie Foster, Christy Turlington and Andie MacDowell, the latter resplendent with grey hair.</p><p id=eC-P1AhP1ImN></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ca2cac27621c-andie-macdowell.jpg><p id=e7dy9deIc0mW data-wc=30>It makes sense that seeing realistic images of older women will boost our self-esteem.
