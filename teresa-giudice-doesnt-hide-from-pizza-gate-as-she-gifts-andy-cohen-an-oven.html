She told a shocked Andy, “Send me your address so I can send you frozen pizza, you’re going to love it.”</p><p>He described it as “amazing” and called it the “famous pizza oven” but it’s believed that Teresa is not selling them to the public due to a proprietary issue. Andy even said he would be bringing it to his new Hamptons house.</p><p>Teresa said she didn’t have time to bring him frozen pizzas due to her daughter Gia’s graduation. “So you can put it right in there and the kids will love them,” before adding that the pizzas take eight minutes to cook.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-inside-skinny-italian-pizza-oven-firm>Inside Skinny Italian Pizza Oven firm</h2><p>When Teresa and Luis decided to do a photo shoot for the pizza ovens, it all kicked off between them and married couple, Melissa and Joe. They made this decision, as well as the name change, without Joe’s input.</p><p>After weeks of Joe trying to get ahold of them, he finally was called by Louie who said, “We don’t see eye to eye, what if Teresa and I do this and give you 5% of the business since it was your idea?” However, Joe said no.</p><p>Louie put out $250K towards Skinny Italian Pizza Oven, which he lost. Teresa had warned Louie not to go through with it, but now he has revealed he <a href=#>let his friend and private investigator, Bo Dietl, collect information</a> on the cast.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Skinny Italian Pizza Ovens are hitting Facebook Marketplace. <a href=#>#RHONJ</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/56yMmkppVE</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/r6ujyCraTV</a></p>— Chadwick (@ohchadwick) <a href=#>April 5, 2023</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-teresa-leaving-rhonj>Is Teresa leaving RHONJ?</h2><p>No, Teresa is not leaving RHONJ despite the rumors.
