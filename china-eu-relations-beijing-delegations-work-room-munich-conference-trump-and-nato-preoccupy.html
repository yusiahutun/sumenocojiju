America must stand strong for democracy. We must stand in defence of international rules and norms, and we must stand with our allies,” Harris said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On Sunday, however, an alternative picture of the future was painted by J.D. Vance, a Republican Senator for Ohio, who said he “can’t speak for Donald Trump … but I think that [Trump] agrees with what I’m going to say”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I don’t think we should pull out of Nato and no, I don’t think we should abandon Europe. But yes, I think that we should pivot, the United States has to focus more on East Asia. That is going to be the future of American foreign policy for the next 40 years, and Europe has to wake up to that fact,” Vance told the conference known as the “Davos of Defence”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Against this backdrop, China fell down the summit’s agenda and its officials were less visible than in previous years. Nonetheless, a sizeable Chinese delegation worked the margins at Munich, taking part in private and public events, looking to capitalise on Europe’s horror at America’s potential retreat from the continental theatre.</p>“No matter how the world changes, China is a responsible major country [that] will keep its major principles and policies consistent and stable … In a turbulent world China will be a force for stability,” Foreign Minister <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Wang Yi told the audience</span></a> on Saturday.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While the speech was loaded with thinly-veiled barbs directed at the US and implied threats not to cross China’s red line, Taiwan, observers thought it was softer in tone than that given by Wang a year earlier, owing to a relative thaw in bilateral ties.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/02/19/2a5efa41-4709-4153-bef7-023458558dfd_1f1a72a2.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">People in the room said that when Wang talked about “promoting China-US relations along the lines of mutual respect”, his gaze was fixed on American officials in the audience.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We’re at a moment where we see cooperation, competition and rivalry in different doses but all across the agendas,” former Spanish foreign minister Arancha Gonzalez told the South China Morning Post on the sidelines of the event.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You can say on China’s behaviour vis-à-vis Russia there was a bit of different tonality from Wang Yi here … he did not talk about an unlimited partnership with Russia.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Beijing sent three delegations to the Bavarian capital, sources said, one led by Wang, a second group of military officials and a third group of think tankers and academics spearheaded by Fu Ying, a former foreign vice-minister.</p>In a diplomatic flurry, Wang met at least 10 foreign ministers, including US Secretary of State <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Antony Blinken</span></a> and Ukraine’s <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Dmytro Kuleba</span></a>, and a number of world leaders, with Germany’s Olaf Scholz and Serbia’s Alexander Vucic among them.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Behind closed doors, other Chinese delegates met and spoke alongside European academics and lawmakers who have been sanctioned by Beijing, and in some cases discussed ways in which the sanctions might be lifted.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a dimly lit room deep in the belly of the Bayerischer Hof, the state-backed Centre for China and Globalisation (CCG), a think tank, hosted a round table encouraging “Climate Cooperation in an Era of Great Power Politics”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Europe must strengthen its ability to defend itself, says Germany</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This discussion on how China, the EU and US can “embrace trilateral climate cooperation … in the current tense geopolitical environment” was attended by a gaggle of Western officials and academics, including Germany’s special envoy on climate Jennifer Morgan, and noted historians Niall Ferguson and Graham Allison.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think the climate is probably the most common threat to mankind and I hope we can go beyond the geopolitical differences … we have to work together,” said Huiyao Wang, president of the CCG.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hildegard Bentele, a German member of the European Parliament who has previously spoken out against Europe’s dependence on China for critical minerals, said she would “advocate at the European Union … to go more actively for global cooperation, also with China”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I hope there will be more activities in international negotiations, and also on a permanent basis with China,” Bentele said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Above ground though, things were a little testier.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The co-chair of the German Social Democratic Party, Lars Klingbeil, became embroiled in a heated exchange with former diplomat Fu when warning Beijing not to attack Taiwan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Attacking Taiwan will completely change our relationship with China, and we’re absolutely clear on this,” Klingbeil said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You said Taiwan and Ukraine are different questions, and I would agree, but I think both are about the question: do we have a multilateral rules-based order?” he told Fu.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Is it normal to change borders with military action? That has to be a clear ‘no’, it’s not OK to change borders by military action.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His remarks earned a stern rebuke from Fu, who said: “I need to start by correcting Mr Klingbeil, between the mainland and Taiwan is not an international border.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Foreign Minister Wang dismissed questions from a moderator on Taiwan and the South China Sea, laughing in his face when he asked if China would accept a “code of conduct” for the region.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In private events too, discussions got heated over the self-governing island. In one instance, a prominent EU lawmaker became involved in a full-throated dispute with a Chinese academic over the issue, according to people present.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/12/04/cui-yonden---clean.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">30:18</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Why Taiwan is a ‘life-or-death question’ for China: Cui Tiankai on US-China tension</p><p>Why Taiwan is a ‘life-or-death question’ for China: Cui Tiankai on US-China tension</p>On another sensitive subject, Fu was asked whether she knew the whereabouts of former foreign minister <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Qin Gang</span></a>, who disappeared from public view in June before being stripped of his role.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Since you are from The Washington Post I guess you know him better than I do,” Fu told the reporter. “And since you are a journalist I am sure you’ve heard the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson response, you don’t need me to repeat it.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China’s close ties with Russia were a subtext to many of the conference’s discussions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In the conversations that I have had, geopolitics is absolutely front of mind. China is part of that, Russia is part of that … I find that they are very nuanced in how the different global players are being seen,” EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager told reporters on the sidelines of the event.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China and ‘good friend’ Hungary shore up policing and security ties</span></p></a></h3>Despite Wang’s meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba, in which he <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">vowed not to “sell lethal weapons”</span></a> to either side in the war with Russia, China’s relationship with Moscow was invoked as a red flag throughout the weekend.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A series of European officials, including the commission president Ursula von der Leyen, warned that China was watching whether the West remained united on Ukraine.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“All the other autocratic adversaries ... are watching very closely whether the democracies stand united,” she said.</p>As well as geopolitics, Gonzalez, the former Spanish foreign minister, said <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">overcapacity</span></a> in the Chinese economy was a major barrier to cooperation with China.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There is a space for everyone because we need to decarbonise the world, but if there’s no fairness in the trading conditions, it will be done in an uncooperative manner, which will result in unilateral measures being taken to manage that,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is the message the EU has been sending to China, [do something about overcapacity] or we will have to use the instruments at our disposal to fight against what Europe perceived as unfair conditions.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelnyltc%2BlpqaZk658or7TopqlnV9of3Z%2BknJqaJuYnruiecSuZKudnJbBqrvNrGSbnZmftq%2BzjJ2cpZ2XlsGqu82sZLCnoqB6s7vOpmSmrZ6esKl5wqiln52imruksYytqa6loGKur7CMp5itp12lv6a7wpysqbE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
