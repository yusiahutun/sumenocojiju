Marshall Meeder, the backup kicker who hadn’t played a snap all year, comes in in relief with four seconds to play and delivers a 38-yard, game-winning field goal in his debut, and the story of the Hawkeye season just keeps getting better. 
“They do a good job keeping you ready, no matter if you’re a backup or if you’re a starter… I felt ready for the day,” Meeder said."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I couldn’t imagine my first play at Iowa trying to go win the game, so I’m happy for him.”</p><p>“I had no worries at all,” Deacon Hill said. “I know Marshall, I love Marshall. Great guy works very hard. I knew that that thing was going in when he came in.”</p><p>“He had a pretty good ovation when he came in the locker room,” Kirk Ferentz said. “I think the reason they like him is because they’ve seen him perform in practice. He’s a serious guy that cares so that’s kind of how football works. If a guy’s got the right attributes and demonstrates it, than people tend to have confidence in them.”&nbsp;</p><p>Hawkeyes reclaimed the Heroes Trophy and walked off a 10-win team for the fifth time in the Kirk Ferentz era. As for what’s next, they’ll wait for the Ohio State-Michigan game on Saturday.&nbsp; They will play the winner in Indianapolis next Saturday.</p><p>For more Hawkeyes football coverage, follow&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#><strong>@BlakeHornTV</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#><strong>@HawkeyeHQ on Twitter</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#><strong>Facebook</strong></a>.
