She faces a maximum sentence of 15 years on the first-degree manslaughter conviction. Under state law, defendants cannot be sentenced for multiple charges pertaining to the same act.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The shooting sparked multiple nights of intense demonstrations in Brooklyn Centre. It happened just a few miles north of where Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, was at the same time standing trial for killing George Floyd, a black man whose 2020 death during an arrest had set off protests in US cities over racism and police brutality.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chauvin was convicted of murder. Both he and Potter are white.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Caught on Potter’s body-worn camera, the basic facts of the incident were for the most part not in dispute. Both prosecutors and the defence lawyers agreed that Potter mistakenly drew the wrong weapon and never meant to kill Wright.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At issue was whether the jury would find her actions to be reckless in violation of the state’s manslaughter statutes, or chalk up the incident to a tragic mistake that did not warrant criminal liability.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Derek Chauvin pleads guilty to violating George Floyd’s rights</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The jury, which agreed on the lesser charge on Tuesday and took two additional days to agree on first-degree manslaughter, went against the expectations of some legal experts who predicted an acquittal or deadlock resulting in mistrial.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wright’s mother, Katie Bryant, said she let out a yelp when she heard the verdict on the most serious count.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Every single emotion that you could imagine, just running through your body at that moment,” Bryant said. “Today, Minnesota has shown that police officers are not going to continue to pull their gun instead of their taser.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Potter and another police officer pulled Wright over because there was an air-freshener illegally hanging from his rear-view mirror and his vehicle’s licence tabs were expired. They then learned of a warrant for his arrest on a misdemeanour weapons charge and sought to detain him. Wright resisted, breaking free from the second officer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/24/ebdf389d-1af0-45f0-a575-af3bcd2403e2_630fafab.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Potter then shouted, “Taser, taser, taser” and fired into Wright’s car, video from her body-worn camera showed. Potter testified that she feared for the life of a third officer who had entered the car through the passenger side and was trying to keep the vehicle in park.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Minnesota criminal defence lawyer Jack Rice, who was not involved in the case, said he believed the video and anti-police sentiment influenced the jury.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In the end, the video was brutal and it’s really difficult to explain away the distinctions between a taser and a firearm,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Throughout the trial, prosecutors stressed Potter’s 26 years as a police officer, experience they said made her mistake indefensible. They said she disregarded her training, which included taser-specific courses in the months before the shooting, and took a conscious and unreasonable risk in using any weapon against the unarmed Wright.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘I shot him. I’m sorry’: Elderly white officer who killed black suspect ‘mistook own gun for taser’</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Potter’s lawyers sought to blame Wright for resisting arrest, which they argued had created a dangerous situation and justified her use of force. While acknowledging her mistake, they said her actions were not criminal because she thought she was using her taser and was unaware she had drawn her handgun.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The defence also leaned heavily on Dr Laurence Miller, a psychologist who testified about “action error”, or when a person takes one action while intending to do another. Miller said such mistakes were common and can be triggered by stress.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Potter’s lawyers took a chance by putting her on the stand. She testified that she was deeply sorry for killing Wright and outlined an otherwise clean record as a police officer. She said she had never discharged her gun before.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Her remorse and regret for the incident is overwhelming,” Paul Engh, one of her lawyers, told the judge in arguing for her to be allowed out on bail until sentencing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXy2usitnJ1lo6mutbHSZpqappGZrnCt0a2gnKSVZIBygo9xcHFnpah6sbvLopqer5%2Birq95yqKkZqifqcGmvoywn6hlnZ7AtbvOpGSgrZ5iwaK%2FxKs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
