After creating an online furor with a stray comment on Monday evening during a livestream, Ingrid Michaelson jumped onto her Instagram Stories late that night to clarify what she meant.
&#34;So, I should be asleep, but it‚Äôs been a crazy hour, hour and a half,&#34; she said. &#34;On my Patreon live stream, I said that I‚Äôm working with Zayn."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"On my Patreon live stream, I said that I‚Äôm working with Zayn. I mentioned that he was married, and he‚Äôs not married. As far as I know, he‚Äôs not married. It was a mistake. I‚Äôm so sorry, I said I was sorry."</p><p>She went on to say that she was surprised at the incredible and immediate reaction. "I don‚Äôt live in this world," she said. "So the level of fame, it makes me really, truly admire <strong>Zayn</strong> and anybody with that level of fame. Every little thing you say is just, Wow! I‚Äôm not built for it."</p><p>"My apologies to <strong>Zayn</strong> and <strong>Gigi</strong>, if any of this trickles to you and is annoying, I‚Äôm sorry, that‚Äôs not my intention," she added. "And to his fans, I‚Äôm sorry for getting you all riled up, and much love to you all. And I‚Äôm gonna go to sleep now."</p><p>Ingrid kept it even simpler on Twitter:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I MADE A MISTAKE IM SORRY BUT ALSO I LOVE THAT LEOPARD PRINT COFFIN BLANKET. <a href=#>https://t.co/Um4GDz88QV</a></p>‚Äî Ingrid Michaelson (@ingridmusic) <a href=#>March 30, 2021</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@ingridmusic</a><p class="divider-block__text divider-block__stroke-color-secondary">Original Story 3/29/2021 8:57 pm PT</p><p>Was she serious? Did she know that this wasn't public knowledge? Is she even right? Well, the public is good and shook right now after Ingrid Michaelson casually dropped the bombshell that <a href=#><strong>Zayn Malik</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Gigi Hadid</strong></a> are married.</p><p>Immediately, the whole phrase "Zayn Is Married" began trending on Twitter -- in all caps no less -- as One Direction fans (and Zayn fans who maybe somehow don't like 1D, if such a creature exists) tried to process this information.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a27765ef-052e-4151-b1a0-f458f9d35c8f data-container-ref=toofab:article:7cc43f83-3e95-420d-9884-e4a5c75ea6f2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ca/5by4/2021/02/04/cac61b09c676454c9c51f19cb851e1d8_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Ethan James Green/Vogue</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Gigi Hadid Details Home Birth As She Covers Vogue Solo For First Time</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Obviously, the speculation has been running rampant for quite a while now, gaining steam in January after Zayn hinted as much that they were wed, or soon might be, in the lyrics to his song, "When Love's Around."</p><p>"I need you in my life / Yeah, you could be my wife for real," he sings on the track. The couple has been together since 2015 and welcomed a daughter in late 2020. Could they have slipped a secret wedding in there somewhere along the way?</p><p>On the livestream, Ingrid was talking about shooting the music video for "To Begin Again," which she did separately from Zayn. In fact, she said that still to this day, they've not met. "I've never spoken to him," she said, per a fan capture.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:ea298f69-3678-4adb-a578-97d7c216f03d data-container-ref=toofab:article:7cc43f83-3e95-420d-9884-e4a5c75ea6f2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b9/5by4/2021/02/06/b9600d96a0194f8880b3279e831eb3ec_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Gigi Hadid Responds to Plastic Surgery Rumors</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p lang=en dir=ltr>. <a href=#>@ingridmusic</a> hey could you please confirm what you meant by ‚Äúzayn is married‚Äù the fandom is really really confused right nowüò≠üò≠üò≠ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/hK9TYy1ezc</a></p>‚Äî zayn‚Äôs favourite desi minion ‚ù¶ (@rhimshahhhh) <a href=#>March 30, 2021</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@rhimshahhhh</a><p>"Zayn doesn't do stuff he doesn't want to do, and the fact that he did this song is very flattering," she continued. "He's such a private person and now he's married and has a child so, he does the things he wants to do."</p><p>Of course, it is possible that she misunderstood his personal situation and Zayn and Gigi are not married. Certainly, as she's never met him or spoken to him, she may have just assumed somewhere along the way that they had gotten married.</p><p>At the same time, maybe she is privy to information that has not been made public through their collaboration, regardless of meeting him or not, and she just didn't know that this wasn't widely known information.</p><p>She certainly didn't drop it like she's revealing major news here, which for Zayn's fans it certainly would be. TooFab has reached out to representatives for Zayn, Gigi and Ingrid for further clarification.</p><p>In the meantime, Twitter is lighting up as fans try and figure out just what it all means ... if anything ... and how excited (and/or devastated) they should be about it.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3070111d-23bc-4eef-8d2e-5ac6b1907d52 data-container-ref=toofab:article:7cc43f83-3e95-420d-9884-e4a5c75ea6f2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b7/5by4/2021/03/29/b7da6b26c3c5497c9e069e60585b8897_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Age March/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Melissa Rivers Joins First Ever Virtual AgeMarch To Help End Age Discrimination</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p lang=en dir=ltr>i know we never stood a chance, but zayn is married now, so um our dreams have just been crushed üò≠ anyways happy for zayn and gigi ü§çüñ§ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/RbeoXBB328</a></p>‚Äî fredy|boysworldfanü©∞ (@makhylisreinbow) <a href=#>March 30, 2021</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@makhylisreinbow</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>me seeing zayn is married trending <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/BJTeIeLIBW</a></p>‚Äî üçì (@cherrycasablanc) <a href=#>March 30, 2021</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@cherrycasablanc</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>OMG ZAYN IS MARRIED CONGRATULATIONS TO GIGI AND ZAYN NOW CAN THEY ADOPT ME <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/WVaS0vP2tX</a></p>‚Äî moonlight (@ponytailxari) <a href=#>March 30, 2021</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@ponytailxari</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ingrid after know if she convinced the whole fandom that zayn is married <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/nFzANVLnST</a></p>‚Äî maya ü¶ñ (@LIGHTSUP2SHE) <a href=#>March 30, 2021</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@LIGHTSUP2SHE</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>ziams after finding out zayn is married <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZdcvKVtrA3</a></p>‚Äî chloe ‚ô°‚Äôs sbgc (@KIWICL0UDS) <a href=#>March 30, 2021</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@KIWICL0UDS</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>me just trying to go about my day and now ZAYN IS MARRIED <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/A0OOwwK4xr</a></p>‚Äî keira (@CANY0NIMPRINT) <a href=#>March 30, 2021</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@CANY0NIMPRINT</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>ingrid really said ‚Äúoh yeah btw zayn is married‚Äù then fucking DIPPED???
