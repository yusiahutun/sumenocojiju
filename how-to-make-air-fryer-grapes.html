In addition to butter, we now spread everything from avocado to hummus to <a href=#>yogurt-based custard</a> on our toast; the sky’s the limit! Grape jelly is another tried-and-true toast topper, though it’s a little overused — so why not put a modern spin on the spread and take it from dull to delightfully delicious? Cooking grapes in an air fryer is a great way to enjoy this fruit spread on toast — sans artificial sweeteners, additives, and preservatives. Another perk of making air fryer grapes? You’ll only need a few ingredients, and it’s quick to prepare. Keep reading to learn how to make this mouthwatering and healthy toast topping.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How To Make Air Fryer Grapes</h2><p>Whether you buy grape jelly in a squeeze bottle or jar, it’s sure to put a fruity spin on any toasted bread. It’s also a key ingredient in the iconic peanut butter and jelly sandwich. But many store-bought varieties of grape jelly are full of sugar and added ingredients. This not only means they’re high in calories, but also that you won’t taste the naturally sweet and tangy flavor from the grapes. While homemade jelly is always an option, it’s time-consuming to prepare. Is there a middle ground?</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>Luckily, there is! Below, food blogger Jasmine Leaf shares how to make air fryer grapes. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Leaf’s recipe</a> requires just three ingredients and four steps — easy-peasy. These air fryer grapes put traditional grape jelly to shame.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Ingredients:</h3><ul><li>4 cups seedless grapes (any variety), <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">thoroughly washed and dried</a></li><li>2 teaspoons avocado oil</li><li>¼ teaspoon salt</li><li>Toasted bread or <a href=#>bagels</a></li><li>Room temperature cream cheese, optional</li><li>Honey, optional</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Directions:&nbsp;</h3><ul><li><strong>Total time:</strong>&nbsp; 15 to 20 mins</li><li><strong>Yield:</strong>&nbsp;5 to 6 servings&nbsp;</li></ul><li>Preheat air fryer to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.</li><li>In bowl, combine grapes, avocado oil, and salt until fruit is fully coated.</li><li>Spread coated grapes onto a parchment-lined air fryer basket or tray. Air fry about 10 minutes or until grapes are softned and fruit juices ooze out of them.</li><li>To serve, place the grapes directly on toasted bread before smushing them. Or spread cream cheese onto toast, place grapes on top, press down on fruit with a fork, and drizzle with honey. Enjoy!</li><p><strong>Note:</strong> Any leftover grapes can be stored in a covered bowl in the fridge. Top over toast, yogurt, oatmeal or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a batch of biscuits</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/Air-fryer-grapes-image_1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>My Taste Test</h2><p>While I love grapes, I’m not typically a huge fan of grape jelly; it’s too cloyingly sweet. I was therefore the perfect candidate to try this recipe — and it didn’t disappoint. My batch of air fried black grapes were mushy and juicy. I placed as many as I could fit onto my toasted sesame bagel before smashing them, allowing the fruit’s sweet and sticky juices to mix with the cream cheese. The grapes were very ripe, so I didn’t even need to drizzle honey over them to sweeten the meal.</p><p>This recipe doesn’t mimic a traditional jelly, where the fruit is stewed with other ingredients to form a thick mixture. Instead, it’s similar to caramelized fruit: The air fryer’s heat brings out the grapes’ natural sugars while keeping their shape intact. My childhood self — whose favorite after-school snack was a PB and J — would’ve been stunned that grapes could replace jelly in any capacity. Thankfully, with age comes a more seasoned palate; and now I can enjoy a much healthier version of morning toast with the help of my <a href=#>air fryer</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonainlGK%2Fpq%2FIqZysZ5ikxG7AzmakmqOVYq6qvoyfqbKdomK0s63Pnqo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
