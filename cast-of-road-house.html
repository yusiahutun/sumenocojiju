But he hopes to do his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Donnie Darko</a> co-star proud. “Patrick was a friend when he was here,” Gyllenhaal shared. “He was always so loving and lovely to me. I take that all to heart in playing the role and there are some things I take from him, but generally we made a whole new movie and I’m really excited about it.”</p><p>We’re sure the rest of the cast of Road House can’t wait to see the premiere of their version. But until then, let’s take a look at the original 1989 cast of Road House, which Swayze once described as “a modern-day western.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>See the original Road House cast then and now</h2><p>The original road house, that is now a cult classic and starred Swayze as&nbsp;a cooler for at a newly refurbished roadside bar who protects a small town in Missouri from a corrupt businessman.

Probably, subconsciously, I still wanted to work out, hopefully, the last of my angry young man syndrome.<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> So Road House was very much a cathartic experience</a>.”</p><p>The Houston-native beautifully balanced his toughness with artistry, thanks largely in part to the influence of his choreographer mother. He even starred as Danny in the original production of Grease on Broadway before transitioning into TV and films.</p><p>His most notable projects include 1983’s The Outsiders, 1984’s Red Dawn, the 1985 miniseries North and South, 1987’s sleeper hit Dirty Dancing, 1990’s Ghost, 1991’s Point Break and 1995’s To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything!

I thought his grace…just spoke volumes about what kind of a man he was. He was a real southern gentleman, Patrick, a gentle man to be around, and somebody who would kick your ass and get it done at the same time. It was a lot of fun to watch him work.”</p><p>Elliott made his film debut as a minor player in 1969’s Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and he went on to be a popular star on TV (1979’s The Sacketts, 1982’s The Shadow Riders, 1983’s The Yellow Rose) and in films such as 1985’s Mask, opposite <a href=#>Cher</a>, 1993’s Tombstone, 2017’s The Hero, and 2018’s A Star Is Born.</p><p>On TV, he’s won a Critics’ Choice Television award for his work on Justified, and he’s been voicing Wild Wild West on the animated series Family Guy since 2019.

You just worry about being the predictable villain. So, you try to find a sense of humor, the opposite colors to play, to play against the evil — and to have some fun with the part.”</p><p>Gazzara, who died in 2012 at the age of 81, started his career on the stage, starring in the original production of 1955’s Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and earning a Tony nomination for A Hatful of Rain that same year.</p><p>Soon, he’d make his debut star turn in film as Jocko De Paris in 1957’s The Strange One, going on to wow audiences in 1959’s Anatomy of a Murder, 1960’s The Passion Thief, 1961’s The Young Doctors, 1976’s The Killing of a Chinese Bookie, 1981’s They All Laughed (opposite <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Audrey Hepburn</a>, with whom he had a brief affair), 1998’s The Big Lebowski, and 1999’s The Summer of Sam.</p><p>He’d return to both the stage — earning Tony award nominations for both 1975’s Huey/Duet and 1976’s Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? — and TV throughout his career, starring in 1985’s An Early Frost and doing a 2001 guest spot on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.
