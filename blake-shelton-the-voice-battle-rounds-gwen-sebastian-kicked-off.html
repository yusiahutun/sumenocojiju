Paul is a natural on stage, with moves and a voice that should make him an easy pick for viewers when the time comes.</p><p>Sebastian, the colorful North Dakotan, and Willett sang Pat Benetar's 'We Belong.' After rehearsals with <a href=#>Miranda Lambert</a> and <a href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a>, the New Yorker told Shelton that her father wasn't doing well. Viewers had met Chuck Willett during the blind audition rounds. He was suffering from pancreatic cancer, and doctors told the family his time was short. The father encouraged his daughter to sing for 'The Voice' win instead of being by his side. Shelton shared that he had gone through a similarly tragic loss, presumably referring to his brother Richie who died in a car accident when the singer was just a teenager.</p><p>The friendship Willett and Sebastian forged in such a short period of time was touching. Sebastian cried for herself, but seemed sincere when saying she was glad she lost to Willett. Sadly, as the credits passed, viewers learned that Chuck Willett had lost his battle.</p><p><strong>Watch Gwen Sebastian Battle Erin Willett on 'The Voice'</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmm6SRoLJuv8eeo62nnmLBqbGMr6aim5Vir6LA06WcZqqfqrulv4ygrp6mXaiyo63SraCapl2gtqS3xJ1kqJ6WZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
