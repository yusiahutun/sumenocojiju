When it comes to good skincare, we’re ready to try some pretty outlandish things to get our skin looking as good as Hailey Bieber’s. This is how we ended up researching a baby ointment that, apparently, works just as well as our beloved Aquaphor —but for a lower price tag."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

For those who might not be familiar: Aquaphor is a use-anywhere healing ointment that’s beloved by skincare obsessives for its ability to heal and repair dry skin. It’s so good, Mrs. Bieber herself <a href=#>swears by it</a>.</p><p>See, it started when we were perusing around <a href=#>online shopping</a> (as we do daily) when we noticed that so many reviewers kept noting the similarity between an <a data-pmc-sp-product=1de3a7ae891f83503a3db7bdf9a851e0 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Amazon baby ointment","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Amazon Basics Healing Ointment for Babies, Pediatrician Tested, 14 Ounce, 1-Pack (Previously Solimo)","price":"9.31","id":"B07RCTTKB3","category":"FSA or HSA Eligible Private Brands"},"id":1336295,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Amazon baby ointment</a> and <a data-pmc-sp-product=e775632b22ba657744be0a4c08284b2a href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Aquaphor","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy Skin Protectant, Body Moisturizer for Dry Skin, Minor Cuts and Burns, Dry Cuticles, Cracked Heels, Hands and Lips, 14 Oz Jar","price":"18.37","id":"B006IB5T4W","category":"Subscribe & Save Promotion Eligible Items"},"id":1336295,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Aquaphor</a> . At first, we thought maybe it was a fluke, but then we took a look at the ingredients and they are literally the same. Each product uses a combination of mineral oil, ceresin, lanolin alcohol, panthenol, glycerin and bisabolol, a soothing oil derived from chamomile. So there you have it: <a href=# id=auto-tag_amazon data-tag=amazon>Amazon</a> shoppers have found the generic version of this beloved name brand treatment, and we have them to thank for the money we will soon be saving!</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/816XqMHQCuL._AC_SL1500_-1.jpg><h2>Solimo Healing Ointment</h2><p>While, yes, this ointment is marketed for babies, shoppers swear they use it on themselves, too. It’s the kind of thing anybody in your home can make use of, really.</p><p>“It’s hands down the best moisturizer that I use on my baby and toddler,” explained one shopper. “I slather it on after bath time, and the next morning their skin is still super soft. It’s also great for diaper changes; if I notice any redness, I use this and she never gets a full-blown diaper rash.” They continued, adding: “I like using it on my cuticles and feet. I douse my feet at bedtime and then put on some socks…my feet feel amazing when I do this regularly.
