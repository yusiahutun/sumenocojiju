While the actor&nbsp;ventured into&nbsp;the next season, he spent&nbsp;time with&nbsp;his twice-married wife. The couple relationship is quite old and blissful, but do&nbsp;they boast&nbsp;any kids?&nbsp;</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Love Life Of Richard</h2><p style=text-align:justify>One of the two howling guys who appears with his bonny cars in the series by Discovery Channel has a strange love life as well.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Well, it may be the words of a shock in the next few lines as the reality TV star was previously married to Karen K Grames, before the marriage to his current wife Suzanne Marie Mergele in 1993. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-198 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>But at the same time, he doesn't have much to talk about his failed marriage which ended up in a year. Moreover, the broken marriage led Richard to another lady to complete his love life.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Know About TV Star:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Billy Brown Wife, Children, Health, Net Worth</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Richard then found his love in Suzanne and got into marital life with her in 1999 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Although it was second for Richard, the marriage went well with her. While everyone was thinking it to be a successful one, they proceeded for a&nbsp;divorce. They filed for the separation and got each other move out of their lives in 2009.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>But, the divorce was not the end of the relation between Richard and Suzanne; instead, they were successful in gathering the same love feelings for each other again. They again tied the knot in Cabo, Mexico in January 2015 but this time, besides making vows, they had something rather notable to commit, and it was regarding their divorce. Richard then&nbsp;opened up the past event as:</p><p style=text-align:justify>“We got&nbsp;divorced&nbsp;while all the [Gas Monkey&nbsp;and&nbsp;Fast N’ Loud] stuff was happening and it was hard for her to put up with it, so it was rough on her for awhile. I’m traveling, I’m gone, and, of course, there are lots of girls out there.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>The remarriage ceremony of Richard and Suzanne in January</strong> <strong>2015&nbsp;</strong>(Photo: starcasm.net)</p><p style=text-align:justify>The couple had no signs of separation and was&nbsp;probably planning on having kids as it was now&nbsp;grown as a happy long together relationship. People&nbsp;got to witness the couple making visits to different places as Richard frequently took&nbsp;their happy moments to Instagram. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Another Happy Couple:-</strong> <a href=# rel=follow>Jordan Connor Dating, Engaged, Fiancee, Net Worth</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Richard also made Suzanne observe his auto shop, Gas Monkey Garage. Richard re-posted an Instagram post where he was with his wife and friends.</p><p style=text-align:justify>While these Instagram posts showed his love for his beloved wife, some tweets showed his marriage refusal gesture for other ladies. However, that thought changed soon enough.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Major Changes In Relationship</h2><p style=text-align:justify>It was back to square one for the Gas Monkey Founder, Richard Rawlings who looked like he was having the best time of his life with wife Suzanne when suddenly things took a turn for the worse.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Following a remarriage with Suzanne in 2015, the couple were ready to start their relationship again but, this time it did not last even as long as the previous time. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Confirming their separation in March 2019, Richard addressed his&nbsp;fans via his social media and ensured that the ex-couple would&nbsp;remain in touch and did not have any harsh feeling for each other.</p><p style=text-align:justify>According to the divorce paper, the Gas Monkey boss is paying $300,000 total&nbsp;and a 2019 Mercedes Sl 450 roadster, which boasts a&nbsp;great value in the market.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-602 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Amidst all the commotion, the reality star again shocked the world when he introduced his stepson- from his second ex-wife's previous relationship-&nbsp;named Sinjin&nbsp;Venegas on one of the episodes of the show. Although&nbsp;a step-father to a mature son, there was no stopping the 50-year-old.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Moving on in life, he proposed his new girlfriend, Katerina Deason during their vacation in Quintana Roo, Mexico.</p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Richard Rawlings proposes Katerina Deason on August 2019</strong> (Photo:&nbsp;Katerina Deason's Instagram) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-603 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Now, the engaged to get married&nbsp;couple are genuinely in love but, looking at his past relation; there is no telling how far the pairing will go.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Richard's Plan Of Building His Empire</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The empire or house buildings of Richard don't include much but the Dallas' Gas Monkey Garage auto shop and Gas Monkey Bar N' Grill. Well, he also owes a Gas Monkey Live concert venue and lately added an eatery place called Richard Rawlings' Garage in Harker Heights which also sells specialty merchandise. He has an excellent reason to do this:</p><p style=text-align:justify>“I am excited and looking forward to serving good food to good people, and I can’t think of anywhere else I would rather have the first location of Richard Rawlings’ Garage be.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><br>Read more here: http://www.star-telegram.com/living/article84645017.html#storylink=cpy<p style=text-align:justify>Later he expanded his restaurants in different parts to serve good food to good people. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-604 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>The car builder is thus trying his luck in different things. Apart from all, he is a TV personality who has signed a contract with the Discovery Channel which yields him $50 thousand per episode. Summing all those up, the hunk has a net worth of $15 million including all of his assets and income.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZquhk52us7CMq5iwpJmjtLR5zaiuZqiRor2mvsinnmavmZuybrPErauippdiuqK%2B0aKcnWWjmrCwusNmn5qulWKur8WMpKCdq16dwa64</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
