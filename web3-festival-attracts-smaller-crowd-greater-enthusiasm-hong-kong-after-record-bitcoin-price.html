The vast majority of participants – an estimated 80 per cent – came from outside Hong Kong, said Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong Wai-lun on Saturday in his opening remarks. The 2024 conference has seen more exhibitors from Europe and the US specifically, according to Lu Weiding, CEO of Wanxiang Group, which owns the event organiser HashKey Group."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The 2024 conference has seen more exhibitors from Europe and the US specifically, according to Lu Weiding, CEO of Wanxiang Group, which owns the event organiser HashKey Group.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As Hong Kong forges ahead with its push to transform into a major crypto hub, it has been attracting more Web3 events to the city and trying to bring in big-name speakers. Investor Cathie Wood, founder of US funds manager ARK Invest, was the most high-profile speaker at this year’s Web3 Festival, although she dialled in remotely for a video chat. She praised Hong Kong’s regulatory efforts and suggested the US is lagging behind.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/07/7a88e90b-7784-4140-97b5-348663406842_eee40472.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are very impressed with what [Hong Kong] has done in providing a comprehensive regulatory framework for exchanges and institutions from a custody point of view,” Wood said in an onstage interview with HashKey Capital. “This regulatory clarity is critical, we think, to enabling the proliferation of the technology faster perhaps in Hong Kong than in the United States.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wood encouraged businesses in Hong Kong to take advantage of existing regulatory arbitrage as a “global opportunity”. She also offered an extremely optimistic view of where the price of bitcoin is headed: US$1.5 million by 2030. Its record price was more than US$73,000 on March 13 and currently sits around US$68,000.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This year’s Web3 Festival started shortly after the conclusion of the WOW Summit and the Liquidity 2024 Institutional Digital Asset Summit, which both dealt with crypto-related topics. Even more events are planned for later this year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">May will see both Wiki Finance Expo and Bitcoin Asia, and Chainlink will host its SmartCon event in Hong Kong in October. CoinDesk – recently acquired by crypto exchange Bullish, which has strong ties to the city – will bring its major Consensus conference to Hong Kong next year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Still, the flood of events risks dividing attention, especially with so many other major events taking place in other locations. Token2049 – which holds its flagship event in Singapore and once took place in Hong Kong – is hosting its Dubai conference in two weeks. Paris Blockchain Week is also this week, and ETH Seoul was the last three days of March.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With other events clustered so closely together, the Web3 Festival was smaller in scale than last year, which happened a few months after Hong Kong announced it’s big crypto push.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/11/03/thumb-clear.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:14</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">FTX crypto exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried convicted by US court on fraud charges</p><p>FTX crypto exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried convicted by US court on fraud charges</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The event this year covers less area in the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai, and it has fewer exhibitors, according to HashKey Exchange CEO Livio Weng. However, the event has more sponsorship revenue than last year, and there are more side events, he said.</p>Hong Kong has maintained its commitment to trying to draw the crypto industry to the city after a number of high-profile scandals and collapses in 2022 and 2023. A mandatory licensing scheme that took effect last year was meant to provide regulatory clarity to make the market more attractive. It has drawn <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">24 applicants so far</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Hong Kong remains the most exciting global opportunity anywhere for a firm wanting to build a virtual assets business or invest in virtual assets,” said Sean Lawrence, head of Asia-Pacific at crypto data provider Kaiko. The city’s advantages include supportive and clear policy directives, a talent pool with experience in traditional finance, and capital to be allocated to virtual assets, he added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, he noted that entrepreneurs and investors should be “prepared to commit significant time, money and effort”, which are necessary to build consumer-protected, sustainable businesses in Hong Kong.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwaavx2iZpaeToLCprcinZpqqpJ6wrbGObGlucGFlhXDDxJtqZp6VqMGqwsClZJqspKeupMDSZqqmmZyhsrN5wqumsJxdnL%2BmrdOeqWadnqm1tr%2FImqqmZZiku6h5yqiloGWRm8GmvoyrnJynopl6o7XTnKaipl2lv6qvxA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
