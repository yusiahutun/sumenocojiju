&#34;I've never really gotten over it,&#34; he tells the latest issue of Rolling Stone. &#34;It was one of the worst times of my life.&#34;
The singer, 32, first got cozy with the actress, 40, in April 2008 after spending five sexy days together in Miami, but went on to split twice — most recently last January, in which he held an impromptu press conference with paparazzi outside his NYC gym to, as he hints, take the blame for the breakup with America's sweetheart."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"It was one of the worst times of my life."</p><p>The singer, 32, first got cozy with the actress, 40, in April 2008 after spending five sexy days together in Miami, but went on to split twice — most recently last January, in which he held an impromptu press conference with paparazzi outside his NYC gym to, as he hints, take the blame for the breakup with America's sweetheart.</p><p>"I'm the asshole," he says. "I burned the American flag. I basically murdered an ideal."</p><p>Instead of moving on, Mayer — who also famously romanced the perpetually single <strong>Jessica Simpson</strong> — says he's stuck on the ones he's already dated.</p><p>"All I want to do now is f— the girls I’ve already f—ed, because I can’t fathom explaining myself to somebody who can’t believe I’d be interested in them," he says about his frustration with dating non-celebrities. "I’m too freaked out to meet anybody else."</p><p>In fact, when he is meeting new people, his old flames pop into his head.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I met a girl one time in Vegas. Her name was Dimples, and the 's' in Dimples was adollar sign," he tells Rolling Stone. "I have this weird feeling, a pride thing, for the people I’ve had relationships with. I still feel like I’m with them, in the sense that if I f—ed Dimples, what does that say about someone like Jen? I feel like it’s all connected. How could I ever cosmically relate these two people?"</p><p>He adds: "What would I be saying to Jen, who I think is f—ing fantastic, if I said to her, ‘I don’t dislike you. In fact, I like you extremely well. But I have to back out of this because it doesn’t arc over the horizon. This is not where I see myself for the rest of my life, this is not my ideal destiny,’ and then I see myself f***ing Dimples? What does that say for my case?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp5ijeq6t2J6pZqGdYsGpsYyaZKGnnJp6p7vRZpmrnZGgtq%2BzjK6nZq%2BZqbVutsSnpaKelad6orrIrKuopl1nfXJ8kWloaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
