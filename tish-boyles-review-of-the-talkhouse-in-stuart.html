The old space was extensively renovated—additions include a large paved patio area with ample seating for alfresco dining, a stylish interior with sliding barn doors and a large bar area with high-top tables, where singer-pianist Bobby Gangloff entertains on Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.</p><p>Though the menu still has a few items remaining from the Courtine’s days (such as the popular burgers), chef-owner David Van Stolk has updated most of the food selections. Included is an array of appetizers, from a classic shrimp cocktail, to fried green tomatoes topped with pimento cheese and bacon, to beef or salmon carpaccio.</p><p>On a friend’s recommendation, my husband and I tried the over-sized meatball, a flavorful blend of beef, pork and veal served with marinara sauce and house-made ricotta cheese. We also sampled the crunchy coconut shrimp, which were coated with panko crumbs, deep-fried and served on plantain slices—it’s a winning combination of flavor and texture. Also notable is the complimentary bread basket; The Talk:house’s version includes an assortment of exceptionally warm and crusty rolls.</p><p>Entrée offerings include six different burgers, a variety of seafood, several pasta dishes and a large selection of meats. We ordered the grilled veal chop served with a pinot noir sauce, farro and asparagus, and the New Zealand rack of lamb, which comes with a cabernet sauce and smashed potatoes.</p><p>For dessert, we indulged in the Apple Galette, served warm with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream. It was worth every calorie.</p><p>Service here is top-notch; our waitress was friendly and professional. I’m already looking forward to my next trip back to The Talk:house, which will undoubtedly be soon.</p><p>The Talk:house, 514 NW Dixie Highway; 772.692.3662;&nbsp;<a href=#>stuartstalkhouse.com</a></p><p><img alt="The Talk:house" height=500 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stu.hourwp-s.innoscale.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2019/03/rack-of-lamb.jpg width=740 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><img alt="The Talk:house" height=500 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stu.hourwp-s.innoscale.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2019/03/stuffed-hogfish.jpg width=740 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tMDUmqmtpZGcrru1zZ5lnKedZLOwu8NmmKecXZm%2FqrrKaKmeq6SWwrOtza1kp52nqHy1tdKhZJunqaGytHnRnq2inadivKd506GcZqyRobipu9SsnGahnmLAtcHAq6to</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
