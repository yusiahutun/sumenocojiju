However, as a rookie, he set a franchise record for the longest kickoff return (101 yards) and was undefeated until 2007. A pivotal moment in Rentzel’s career came in 1967 when he was traded to the Dallas Cowboys.</p><p>Rentzel was a standout wide receiver in the league, even when he was positioned as a flanker.

Furthermore, in 1969, Rentzel led the NFL in yards per catch (22.3) and receiving touchdowns (12).</p><p>His exceptional play earned him an All-Pro selection in 1966 and two Pro Bowl selections in 1967. Most importantly, Rentzel was essential to the Cowboys’ four straight postseason trips and 1970 Super Bowl victory.</p><p>Rentzel was a productive wide receiver with the Los Angeles Rams after being traded to them in 1971. He led the team in receptions in 1971 and 1972 and finished second in receiving yards. In 1973, his efforts also aided the Rams in winning the NFC West division.

This activity happened more than once without anyone noticing or reporting it. He clarified that he used it as a coping mechanism for the stress and worry associated with his football career and that he felt regret and guilt after every event.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.playerswiki.com/uploads/2023/11/23/lance-rentzel-1700731281.jpg><p>In a Dallas suburb, he flashed a 10-year-old girl in November 1970, revealing his secret. The Cowboys charged him, put him in jail, and suspended him. He paid $1,000, received two years of probation and therapy, and acknowledged to having been exposed indecently.</p><p>His career and reputation were destroyed by the controversy.

According to some accounts, he got married again, had two kids, converted to Christianity, and gave to charity.</p><p>Legal and financial difficulties beset Rentzel; he was arrested in the 1970s for driving under the influence and for possessing marijuana. In 1981, he filed for bankruptcy, which resulted in the loss of his house and other possessions.</p><p>He also struggled with conditions like diabetes, heart troubles, and arthritis. Later, he relocated to Washington, D.C., where he worked as a consultant and lobbyist before moving back to Dallas, where he now resides as of 2021.</p><p>Rentzel, who is 80 years old, has kept a modest public profile.
