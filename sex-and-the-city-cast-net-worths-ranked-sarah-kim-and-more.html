The series follows Sarah (Carrie Bradshaw), Cynthia (Miranda Hobbes) and Kristin (Charlotte York Goldenblatt) as “they navigate the journey from the complicated reality of life and friendship in their 30s to the even more complicated reality of life and friendship in their 50s.”</p><p dir=ltr>Kim’s beloved character, Samantha Jones, did not make a comeback in the highly anticipated series. In July 2019, the&nbsp;Sexual Intelligence&nbsp;author made it clear she has no interest in reprising her role. “Never. It’s a no from me,” Kim told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-linkindex=5>MailOnline</a>&nbsp;at the time. “You learn lessons in life and my lesson is to do work with good people and try and make it fun.”</p><p dir=ltr>Despite Kim and Sarah’s characters having a beautiful onscreen friendship, their relationship in real life couldn’t be more different. In February 2018, Kim publicly called out Sarah on Instagram after she shared her condolences for the death of Kim’s brother, Chris. “I don’t need your love or support during this tragic time,” the&nbsp;Police Academy&nbsp;alum wrote.</p><p dir=ltr>“Your continuous reaching out is a painful reminder of how cruel you really were then and now,” Kim continued. “Let me make this VERY clear. (If I haven’t already). You are not my family. You are not my friend. So, I’m writing to tell you one last time to stop exploiting our tragedy in order to restore your ‘nice girl’ persona.”</p><p dir=ltr>During an episode of&nbsp;Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen&nbsp;that month, Sarah told longtime friend and show host&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-linkindex=6>Andy Cohen&nbsp;</a></strong>her side of the matter. “I found it very upsetting because that’s not the way I recall our experience,” the&nbsp;Hocus Pocus&nbsp;actress said. “So, it’s sad, but I always think that what ties us together is this singular experience.”</p><p dir=ltr>Sex and the City isn’t the same without Samantha, but it is a total blast from the past seeing Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte back on television again!</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to see who the richest cast member of&nbsp;Sex and the City is.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46snLFlkaOxbsDHnmScoaSueqSt0q1kp52kYsSwvtOhqmaqkaO4prCMrJirmZhiuKq5jJqlnWWdpL%2Bmew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
