Both Mom and Klein are healthy," the Moores say in a statement to <a href=#>People</a>.</p><p>The baby, who is named after her paternal great-grandmother, will be called by her middle name. Klein weighed in at 6 lbs., 13 oz. at birth and was 19 and a quarter inches long. The sweet baby joins big sisters Kennedy Faye, 2.5, and Ella Kole, 4.</p><p>Moore has taken time out of his hectic touring schedule to help his family ease into life as a unit of five, and previously admitted that he and his wife were <a href=#>armed and prepared </a>for the newborn to make his or her appearance. After all, they'd already done the newborn thing twice before.</p><p>The Moores did not find out the baby's sex -- the country singer <a href=#>shared</a> that his wife didn't want to find out, and "she wins most battles." Of course, after two girls, many were wondering if the new baby would be a first-time boy. Moore himself has <a href=#>discussed his hopes for a boy</a> someday, explaining that they've talked about as many as four or five kids. But don't think for a second that he was disappointed with another daughter; he also said that if a boy wasn't in the cards, he was fine with it.</p><p>No doubt, the 'Point at You' singer is thrilled to add another sweet girl to his brood -- he better start saving his pennies now for all the weddings he'll need to pay for!</p><p>Congratulations to the Moore family on their tiny addition!</p><p><strong>Justin Moore Dishes on His Tattoo for Daughter Kennedy</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo62jqbavecyopqudXaOyuHnBmpmyZZeev617</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
