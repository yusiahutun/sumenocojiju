I am in my second month of therapy. The trauma I went through after finding out the truth and some ugly stuff left me shaking. I went for days without food and no sleep, questioning and answering myself. It has been very heavy some days, a night will just break into a day with me looking outside the window gazing at nothing. I would be shaking for reasons I can't explain..." she wrote in part.<p class=align-left>The mother of five said she had to put on a brave face and pretend everything was okay, yet deep down, all was not well. She thanked her ex-manager, Nelly Okas, her children and a few friends for supporting her during the difficult time.</p>"Nelly Oaks has been on speed dial. He would call me nonstop and would panic when my phone went off, my children, especially the girls made sure we FaceTime just to check if I was okay.
